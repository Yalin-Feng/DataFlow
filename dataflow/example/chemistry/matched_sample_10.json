Compared with norbornyl/amine or ethynyl terminated polyimides, phenylethynyl terminated polyimides exhibit many advantages2–5 such as (1) no evolution of volatiles during the cure reaction, (2) larger processing window, (3) excellent mechanical properties, in particular outstanding fracture tough- ness value, and (4) higher hydrolytical stabilities. NASA’s PETI-5, for example, received enormous at- tention during the development of the high speed civil transportation program. It crosslinks between 320 and 371°C range and at a pressure of 1 MPa, which can be easily processed by resin transfer molding (RTM).6 PETI-5 polyimides demonstrated excellent hot/wet properties and high toughness (strain to failure from 14 to 84% in the 23–177°C temperature range).6 How- ever, the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PETI-5 is low, which is about 270°C.\n\nCorrespondence to: R.

The cure reaction of AFR- PEPA-4 imide oligomer can be described as a fast ﬁrst-order reaction stage for the formation of polyenes followed by a slow diffusion-controlled crosslinking reaction stage. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Unfortunately, AFR 700B polyimide experi- enced signiﬁcant decreases in strength ( 70%) and Tg (75°C) after 1000 h at 160°C in a hygrothermal pressure bomb environment.8,9 The hydrolyzable weak link was found to be norbornene crosslinks, which originate from the nadic end-caps. Recently, AFR-PEPA-N imide oligomer was synthesized with the ﬂuorinated backbone 6FDA and the phenylethy- nyl end-caps, 4-(phenylethynyl)phthalic anhydride (PEPA).7 AFR-PEPA-N exhibited only a 3–5% de- crease in dry Tg after hygrothermal exposure, which is similar to PETI-5.7 In addition, AFR-PEPA-N polyim- ides showed (1) extremely high Tgs (435–455°C), (2) signiﬁcantly improved mechanical properties at 300°C compared with AFR 700B, (3) the potential to be pro- cessed by RTM, (4) high ductility for a high tempera- ture polyimide (ambient temperature elongation to break of 5%), and (5) slightly lower thermo-oxidative stability compared with AFR 700B.7 Therefore, AFR- PEPA-N polyimides were promptly deployed on ultrahigh temperature light weight composites for aerospace structural applications. However, no stud- ies, as yet, have been performed to characterize the network of AFR-PEPA-N polyimides and the effects of thermal history on the cured products. Cure reactions and kinetics of AFR-PEPA-N oligomers need to be\n\ninvestigated, to further understand the structure- property-processing relations of AFR-PEPA-N poly- imides.\n\nSeveral studies on the thermal cure of phenylethy- nyl terminated imide oligomers have been reported. Johnston et al.10 synthesized and characterized a series of phenylethynyl end-capped imide oligomers with PEPA and substituted PEPAs containing electron- withdrawing groups. Takekoshi and Terry11 studied thermal reactions of two PEPA model compounds, N-[3-(phenylethynyl)phenyl]phthalimide and N-phe- nyl-4-(phenylethynyl)phthalimide, by using high- pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ﬁeld- desorption mass spectroscopy. Fang et al.12 studied the kinetic mechanism of thermal cure of PETI-5 oli- gomer by thermal analysis using the modiﬁed DiBenedetto equation. It was found that thermal cure reaction of PETI-5 was 1.5th order, which suggested that complicated reaction mechanisms such as in- tramolecular and bimolecular double bond addition reactions are involved to form a highly crosslinked polyimide. Solid-state 13C NMR was also used to an- alyze the chemical structure of cured acetylene-termi- nated polyimides or acetylene containing model com- pounds.13–15 Although phenylethynyl groups are ex- pected to react by chain extension, crosslinking, and branching, it is still difﬁcult to elucidate the cure ki- netics and mechanism of thermal cure of phenylethy- nyl-terminated imide oligomer because of the steric effect of the phenyl-ended functional groups, low con- centration of phenylethynyl groups in the oligomers, and insolubility of the cured products.\n\nIn the present study, thermal cure reactions of phe- nylethynyl-terminated AFR-PEPA-4 imide oligomer and a model compound N-phenyl-[4-(phenylethy- nyl)phthalimide] were characterized by infrared spec- troscopy (IR). The kinetics analysis of thermal cure of AFR-PEPA-4 imide oligomer was determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) by following the Tg of the cured polyimides as a function of cure, which was simulated by the modiﬁed DiBenedetto equation. The aim of this work is to understand the thermal cure kinetics and mechanism of phenylethy- nyl-terminated imide oligomer AFR-PEPA-N.\n\n\\begin{title}\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\\end{title}\n\n\\begin{title}\nMaterials\n\\end{title}\n\n2,2 -Bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl)hexaﬂuoropropane dian- hydride (6FDA), 1,4-diaminobenzene (p-PDA), and 4-(phenylethynyl)phthalic anhydride (PEPA) were ob- tained from Performance Polymer Solutions, OH.

The solution of 6FDA/NMP was then added in p-PDA/NMP solution, in three portions over 3 h. Once all of the 6FDA solution was added, stirring continued for 20 h at room temperature. PEPA (6.459 g, 0.026 mol) was added as a solid and was stirred until it completely reacted (4 h) under nitrogen. The NMP used is 10% solids by weight during the whole synthesis. Toluene was then added, and the resulting mixture was then imidized under reﬂux in 180°C-oil bath with the removal of water via azeotro- pic distillation. The reaction mixtures were ﬁnally added into distilled water, ﬁltered, and washed in boiling water and then in warm methanol to remove the NMP. This produced very ﬁne yellow powders that were dried under vacuum for 24 h at 160°C. The yield was 33.387 g (97.5%). The oligomer had a theo- retical molecular weight of 2634 g/mol and a glass transition temperature of 250°C (DSC) at 20°C/min. The chemical structure of AFR-PEPA-4 imide oli- gomer is shown in Figure 1(a).\n\n\\begin{title}\nN-Phenyl-[4-(phenylethynyl) phthalimide]\n\\end{title}\n\nPhenylethynyl model compound N-phenyl-[4-(phe- nylethynyl) phthalimide] was prepared following the method reported by Takekoshi and Terry.11 PEPA (31.029 g, 0.125 mol), aniline (12.200 g, 0.131 mol), and 225 mL of acetic acid were placed in a 500-mL, three- necked ﬂask. The mixture was stirred under nitrogen\n\nand heated to reﬂux for 1.5 h. A total of 50 mL of water and acetic acid mixture was distilled off during the following 0.5-h period. The reaction mixture was cooled and the yellow crystalline solid was ﬁltered. The product was washed with methanol and dried. The yield was 38.883 g (96.2%), mp 210–212°C.

The chemical structure of AFR-PEPA-4 is shown in Figure 1(b).\n\n\\begin{title}\nCure reactions of the model compound and AFR- PEPA-4 oligomer\n\\end{title}\n\nThe range of reaction temperatures chosen for thermal cure of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer and the model com- pound was determined by thermal analysis. Thermo- gravimetric analysis (TGA) of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer was performed on a TGA Q500 thermal analyzer. The heating atmospheres were air or nitrogen. The sam- ples were heated to 800°C at 10°C/min. DSC analysis was performed by a Perkin–Elmer DSC Pyris 7 sys- tem. Temperature was scanned from 100 to 450°C at 20°C/min.\n\nAbout 0.2 g samples were cured in small glass vials in a preheated furnace. After curing at the desired temper- ature for a certain time (from 2 min to 8 h), the samples were cooled promptly and removed from the vials for characterization. FTIR analysis was used to monitor the reaction conversion after curing. A Nicolet AVATAR 360 spectrometer was used in this study. Samples were pre- pared as KBr pellets. The number of accumulations was set at 64 with a resolution of 2 cm 1.\n\nTgs of cured AFR-PEPA-4 were measured by DSC at a heating rate of 20°C/min under nitrogen atmo- sphere. The modiﬁed DiBenedetto equation12,16,17 was used to calculate the reaction extent x according to Tg as follows\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{T_{g}-T_{g 0}} {T_{g^{\\infty}} \\!-\\! T_{g^{0}}} \\!=\\! \\frac{\\lambda x} {1 \\!-\\! ( 1 \\!-\\! \\lambda) x}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere Tg0, Tg , and Tg are the glass transition temper- atures before complete cure, after complete cure, and the glass transition temperature of the sample after curing at a cure temperature for a speciﬁed cure time, respectively. is the ratio of isobaric heat speciﬁed time of the fully cured material to that of uncured material. The isobaric heat capacities can be deter- mined by DSC. It should be noted that even if the selected Tg does not correspond to the theoretically ideal fully cured system, cure extent x is still valid for kinetic analysis according to this equation.12\n\n\\begin{token}\n(1)\n\\end{token}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTABLE I TGA Results of AFR-PEPA-4 Oligomer\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{table}\n| ('Weight loss (%)', 'Weight loss (%)')   | ('Temperature (℃)', 'Air')   | ('Temperature (℃)', '$N ₂2$')   |\n|:-----------------------------------------|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------------|\n| 1                                        | 339.6                        | 342.8                           |\n| 2                                        | 480.1                        | 488.6                           |\n| 5                                        | 524.2                        | 527.4                           |\n| 10                                       | 543.8                        | 548.7                           |\n| 20                                       | 564.8                        | 584.5                           |\n\\end{table}\n\nHeating rate 10°C/min.\n\n\\begin{title}\nCure characterization of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer\n\\end{title}\n\nThe temperatures for various weight losses of AFR- PEPA-4 oligomer calculated from TGA are listed in Table I. In nitrogen atmosphere, the temperatures for 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20% weight losses of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer are higher than those in air. The oligomer has less than 2% weight loss in both air and N2 when the temperature is lower than 480°C. A DSC study of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer shows that the cure reaction starts at 370°C and reaches the peak at 410°C. On the basis of the thermal analysis results, the temperature window for thermal curing of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer can be chosen from 340 to 430 °C to ensure the occur- rence of crosslinking reaction without serious thermal degradation. In this article, the cure temperatures 350, 370, 390, and 410°C were chosen to study the effect of temperature on cure reactions of AFR-PEPA-4 oli- gomer.\n\nFTIR spectra of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer is shown in Figure 2. Since the absorption around 2213 cm 1 is attributed to C'C in ethynyl group, the reaction con- version of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer during the curing can be given by the consumption of C'C triple bonds through the calculation of the decreased intensities of the bands at 2213 cm 1. The absorption of imide CAO stretching around 1726 cm 1 and 1785 cm 1, inert from the reactions, can be used as internal standard. Absorption bands around 1511 cm 1 and 1367 cm 1 are attributed to benzene ring and aromatic imide CON stretching, respectively. The reaction conversion can be calculated by relative intensity ratio compared between the intensity of the reaction involved peaks and that of internal standard. The reaction conversion can be calculated by eq. (2)\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha=\\left( \\frac{I^{2 2 1 3}} {I^{1 7 8 5}} \\right)_{t} / \\left( \\frac{I^{2 2 1 3}} {I^{1 7 8 5}} \\right)_{t=0}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{token}\n(2)\n\\end{token}\n\nThe quantitative results are shown in Figure 3. The reaction conversion of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomers in-\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 2 FTIR spectra of AFR-PEPA-4 imide oligomer.\n\\end{caption}\n\ncreased with the increase of cure time, when they were cured at 350°C in air atmosphere. However, when the cure time is longer than 1 h and the reaction conver- sion is more than 85%, FTIR cannot detect the 2213 cm 1 band because of the limited resolution and the relatively low concentration of phenylethynyl groups in AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer. On the basis of the calcula- tion from residual exothermal reaction H in DSC test, the curing is not complete even over 8-h cure at 350°C and the degree of cure is about 90%.\n\nA plot ln [1 ] versus t for the cure reaction of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer at 350°C in 1 h yields a straight line, which is shown in Figure 4. Therefore, according to cure conversion calculated from FTIR data, the cure kinetic obeys ﬁrst order during the ﬁrst 1 h at 350°C.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 3 Reaction conversion of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer versus cure time at 350°C from FTIR data.\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 4 Reaction kinetic plot of ln (1 ) versus time for thermal cure of AFR-PEPA-4 at 350°C from FTIR data.\n\\end{caption}\n\nTgs of cured AFR-PEPA-4 were determined by DSC. An illustration of the Tg before and after cure at 350°C is shown in Figure 5. The plot of Tg versus cure time of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer cured at 350°C is shown in Figure 6. The increase of Tg is almost linear in the ﬁrst 1 h of curing. After that, the increase of Tg has a remarkable drop due to diffusion restriction. On the basis of the modiﬁed DiBenedetto eq. (1), the depen- dence of Tg on reaction conversion of phynylethynyl C'C in AFR-PEPA-4 oligomers can be simulated, which is shown in Figure 7, indicating that good agreement between the simulated curve and experi- mental data from FTIR. Therefore, this simulation method is reliable to calculate the reaction conversions based on measured Tgs.\n\nThe dependences of Tg of cured oligomers on cure time at various cure temperatures in air are shown in\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 5 DSC curves of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer before and after cure at 350°C.\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 6 Tg versus cure time of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer cured at 350°C.\n\\end{caption}\n\nFigure 8. The Tg of the cured oligomer increases with the increase of cure time and cure temperature. The cure temperature 410°C gave the highest cure reaction rate at the beginning of the curing, at which the sam- ple’s Tg went to 381°C, with only 5 min curing. The cure reaction rate tends to be stable after the curing reaches a certain extent because of the diffusion con- trol. The Tgs of cured oligomers after 8 h curing at 350, 370, 390, and 410°C are 371, 385, 398, and 418°C, respectively.\n\nSince FTIR cannot detect the absorption of residue phenylethynyl group in the highly crosslinked AFR- PEPA-4 polyimide, in our study, the reaction conver- sion of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer cured at various tem- peratures can be calculated from the Tg of cured sam- ples by using modiﬁed DiBenedetto equation obtained earlier. Tgs as a function of reaction conversion are shown in Figure 9.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 7 Tg as a function of reaction conversion of AFR- PEPA-4 oligomer cured at 350°C.\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 8 Tg versus cure time of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer cured at various temperatures.\n\\end{caption}\n\nA plot of the ln (1 ) versus cure time (Fig. 10) for a ﬁrst-order reaction shows signiﬁcant deviation from linearity once the reaction conversion exceeds 80%. If only the experimental points below 80% cure are selected, ﬁrst order kinetics better simulates the ki- netic data (Table II). Thus, the activation energy Eact can be obtained by plot ln k versus 1/T (Fig. 11), which is 34.1 2.4 kcal/mol with a regression coefﬁcient of 0.995.\n\nFang et al.12 investigated the cure reaction of PETI-5 and found that it followed ﬁrst order kinetics yielding an activation energy of 37.2 kcal/mol when the cure process was below 90%. It is close to our result for curing of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer. Studies on solid- state 13C NMR showed that the primary thermal cure reaction ( 70%) of acetylene-terminated imide oli- gomers is ethynyl to ethynyl addition that forms poly-\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 9 Tg as a function of reaction conversion of cured AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer.\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 10 Kinetic plots of ln (1 – ) versus time from DSC Tg data.\n\\end{caption}\n\nene structures.13 Although Diels-Alder cycloaddition between two phenylethynyl groups was expected to be the most probable crosslink mechanism for imide oligomers containing internal acetylene units,15 phe- nylethynyl-terminated imide oligomers may not fol- low this mechanism, because the molecular motion at the internal acetylene groups is more restricted than at the termini. Fang et al.12 also described a 1.5th order kinetics for whole cure reaction of PETI-5, with an activation energy of 33.8 kcal/mol. However, in our study, this reaction order failed to describe the data over the whole range of conversion values for com- plete cure. Since 6FDA gives the backbone of AFR- PEPA-4 imide oligomer a higher degree of rotation,15 the further reaction of polyenes may be more compli- cated. The heats of reaction do not adequately deﬁne the reaction for complete cure.\n\n\\begin{title}\nThermal reaction of N-phenyl-[4-(phenylethynyl) phthalimide]\n\\end{title}\n\nCompared with AFR-PEPA-4 imide oligomer, the model compound N-phenyl-[4-(phenylethynyl) phthal-\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTABLE II Kinetic Analysis of the Thermal cure of AFR-PEPA-4 by DSC (First Order Below 80% Cure)\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{table}\n| Temperature (℃)   | Rate constant (min−1)   | Regression coefficient   |\n|:------------------|:------------------------|:-------------------------|\n| 350               | 0.0339                  | 0.973                    |\n| 350^              | 0.02967                 | 0.988                    |\n| 370               | 0.06952                 | 0.911                    |\n| 390               | 0.14797                 | 0.965                    |\n| 410               | 0.3893                  | 1                        |\n\\end{table}\n\na Analysis by reaction conversion data from FTIR.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 11 Kinetic plot of ln k versus 1/T of the cure reac- tion of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer for ﬁrst order (below 80% cure).\n\\end{caption}\n\nimide] has much more concentrated phenylethynyl groups in its chemical structure, which allows us to easily monitor the consumption of C'C in phenylethy- nyl during the cure reaction by IR study.\n\nDSC data of N-phenyl-[4-(phenylethynyl) phthalim- ide] showed a sharp peak for the melting at 210°C. The reaction started from 320°C and reached the peak at 397°C. Thermal reactions of this model compound at various temperatures 330, 350, 370, and 390°C were monitored by FTIR, using the procedure similar to that for AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer. From the IR spectra shown in Figure 12(a), the absorption peak of 2216 cm 1 decreases with the increase of cure time, indi- cating the consumption of C'C triple bonds during thermal reaction. Moreover, it was found that the in- tensity of another absorption band around 1611 cm 1, which could be attributed to stretching vibrations of CAC conjugated with ethynyl group,18 also decreased during the reaction [Fig. 12(b)]. It was observed that the absorption band of phenylethynyl group switches to lower wavenumbers and that of conjugated bonds switches to higher wavenumbers during the thermal reaction. However, in IR spectra of phenylethynyl- terminated imide oligomers, the absorption at 1611 cm 1 always overlaps with 1580 cm 1, which is attrib- uted to aromatic structure itself.\n\nThe quantitative results are shown in Figure 13. The reaction conversion of N-phenyl-[4-(phenylethynyl) phthalimide] increased with the increase of cure time.

Therefore, the whole thermal re- action of N-phenyl-[4-(phenylethynyl) phthalimide] cannot be simply described with ﬁrst order kinetics.\n\nFang et al.12 proposed a two-stage kinetic/diffusion model for thermal curing of PETI-5 oligomer, which may also be valid for AFR-PEPA-4 system.

On a slow second stage, crosslinking reaction is kinetically controlled by diffusion. The double bond addition reactions mainly occur in this stage. A series of reactions such as Diel-Alder, Friedel- Crafts, Straus and Glaser coupling reactions have been suggested.12 The formation of polycyclic aromatic structures derived from polyene causes the signiﬁcant deviation from linearity of ﬁrst order reaction, once the reaction conversion of the triple bond in phenyl- ethynyl groups exceeds 80%.\n\n\\begin{title}\nCONCLUSIONS\n\\end{title}\n\nThermal cure of phenylethynyl terminated imide oli- gomer AFR-PEPA-4 and model compound N-phenyl- [4-(phenylethynyl) phthalimide] were characterized. The changes in IR absorbance of phenylethynyl triple bonds at 2216 cm 1 and that of conjugated bonds at 1611 cm 1 of N-phenyl-[4-(phenylethynyl) phthalim-\n\nide] were detected. Thermal reaction of the model compound followed the kinetics with an order of 0.95. DSC was used in determining the cure kinetics of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer by following the increase in Tg as a function of cure. The activation energy of thermal cure reaction of AFR-PEPA-4 oligomer is 34.1 2.4 kcal/mol with the kinetic order of one, when the reaction conversion is less than 80%. The cure process of imide oligomer can be described as a fast ﬁrst order reaction stage forming polyene structures, followed by a slow diffusion-controlled crosslinking reaction stage.\n\n1.

Using the cis-trans property of a functionalized sulfonated azo chromophores, we have fabricated graded index waveguides with low loss, which is due to graded index sidewalls. Fabrication is done by exposing the polymer ﬁlm to a 532 nm wavelength laser beam focused to about 5 m spot at the ﬁlm. Losses were calculated to be 0.48 0.04 dB/cm at 830 nm wavelength with no surface deformation. This technique enables us to fabricate integrated optical circuits including directional couplers, dividers, ﬁlters, switches, etc., as they are currently investigated in our laboratory. © 2008 American Institute of Physics. DOI: 10.1063/1.2838341\n\nWith the advances in photonics and optical communica- tions and increase in bandwidth demand, there is an ever increasing need to move toward optical integrated circuits. To do so, convenient techniques and materials are needed to make this technology possible. Because of their ease of fab- rication, low cost, and refractive index compatible with op- tical ﬁbers, polymeric materials are becoming attractive al- ternatives for nonlinear optical inorganic materials such as LiNbO3 or GaAs. Although currently produced in small scale, the polymeric materials used here can be produced in large scale at a relatively low cost and, therefore, offer com- pelling commercial advantages for the marketplace. The cost advantage of producing and fabricating organic polymeric integrated circuits is substantial compared to inorganic ma- terials such as silicon, GaAs, and LiNbO3. Fast redesign ca- pability will allow product cycles to be short and more efﬁ- cient. This capability provides us with an accelerator to meet demand, improve performance, and optimize additional functionalities for photonic applications.\n\nSeveral devices such as Mach-Zehnder modulators and couplers,1–5 gratings,6 and photonic crystals7 have been in- vestigated using polymeric photonic materials. Fabrication of these components is being investigated in our laboratory us- ing our fabrication technique. We have previously demon- strated the fabrication of a grating based switch using the direct writing method.6 Polyimide functionalized with azo chromophores exhibits photoinduced birefringence8,9 due to reorientation of the azo chromophores by the cis-trans isomerization process. When exposed to light within their absorption band, this cis-trans isomerization induces align- ment in the chromophore in a direction perpendicular to the polarization of the exciting light, which reduces absorption. Birefringence resulting from this alignment of azobenzene groups could be used for producing waveguides or inducing\n\na Electronic mail: agharavi@shayda.com. b Currently at Raytheon Corporation.\n\n\\begin{title}\n0003-6951/2008/92 4 /041105/3/$23.00\n\\end{title}\n\nDownloaded 12 Apr 2013 to 137.149.3.15.

Reuse of\n\nindex modulation into the depth of the polymers as well.6 Using optimized low power writing beams, we can make low loss graded index waveguides with no surface deformation. In this way, our index change is strictly due to the cis-trans isomerization. The signiﬁcance of this work is not in the material used in this experiment but is to show the potential in a family of materials that have the cis-trans property and different optical and nonlinear properties. Similar index- changing effects such as photobleaching10,11 and photother- mal and/or photochemical12 cause signiﬁcant surface deformation.\n\nThe material used here consists of a functionalized soluble polyimide with an azo optical chromophore. The chromophores were chemically attached to the host polymer for better optical and thermal stability. This material was synthesized by an approach similar to that of Saadeh et al.13 The absorption spectrum and chemical structure of the poly- meric material used are shown in Fig. 1. To make thin ﬁlms\n\n\\begin{legend}\n(a)\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\n(b)\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFIG. 1. a Chemical structure of the polymeric material used in this work and b absorption spectrum of the polymeric material.

The precision X-Y stage is controlled by the computer which moves the sample in the direction of the waveguide.\n\\end{caption}\n\nof these polymers, 300 mg of the polymer material was dis- solved in 2 ml of dimethyl formamide. The solution was then ﬁltered with a 0.2 m ﬁlter and the total volume was re- duced to about 1 ml. The solution was then spin coated on 2.5 3.8 cm2 glass substrates. Depending on the spinning speeds, the ﬁlm thickness ranged between 2 and 3 m. These ﬁlms were then cured at 200 °C to form a hard ﬁlm.\n\nFor waveguiding of a given mode to occur in a wave- guide, the following index condition must be satisﬁed:14\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta n=( n_{2}-n_{c} ) \\ge\\frac{m_{s}^{2} \\lambda^{2}} {1 6 t^{2} ( n_{2}+n_{c} )}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{w h e r e} \\ m_{s}=2 m+1 \\, ; \\quad m=0, 1, 2, \\, \\ldots\\,,\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{token}\n1\n\\end{token}\n\nwhere n2 and nc are the refractive indices of the guide and cladding, t is the thickness of the guiding layer, m is the mode number, and is the wavelength of the guided light. For a 3 m ﬁlm with a refractive index of about 1.6 at 830 nm wavelength, the minimum necessary change in the refractive index is about n=0.0014 for m=1. The refractive index of our polymer changes when exposed by a laser beam within the absorption range of the polymer. When measured by the prism coupler, the coupling angle of the waveguide and the ﬁlm differed by 1°. This gave a n of about 0.01 between the waveguide and the ﬁlm. This change is enough to write waveguides which can conﬁne the light. To write waveguides using the laser-writing technique, the apparatus of Fig. 2 was constructed.\n\nThe X-Y stage has a resolution of 0.1 m. A computer program was written to control the stage for writing waveguides. The width of the written waveguide on the ﬁlm depends on the waist and intensity of the writing laser beam and also on the speed of the moving ﬁlm. The beam waist was controlled by a microscope objective located above the surface of the ﬁlm, as shown in Fig. 2. The distance between the objective and the ﬁlm was controlled by a microposi- tioner. The intensity and the polarization of the laser beam were adjusted by two polarizers. Rotating the upper polarizer adjusts the intensity of the laser light passing through it and the lower polarizer ensures the appropriate polarization needed to write the waveguide. The wavelength of the writ- ing beam is at the edge of the absorption spectrum of our polymer, as shown in Fig. 1 b . This way, uniform waveguides could be written in the depth of the polymer ﬁlm.\n\nDownloaded 12 Apr 2013 to 137.149.3.15. This article is copyrighted as indicated in the abstract.

The coupled light 832 nm into an “s-curve” waveguide observed from above by a CCD camera. The waveguiding path is clearly observed by the scattered light. Inset: Waveguide proﬁle observed through a polarizing microscope which shows the graded nature of the waveguide. We intention- ally chose a waveguide with high scattering path so that it would appear clearly in the picture.\n\\end{caption}\n\nAs experimentally determined, when the objective was at the focal point, the waist of the beam was about 2 m on the ﬁlm. To write a waveguide with a width of 5 m, we moved the objective position 20 m upward. The power of the writing laser beam, having a Gaussian proﬁle, deter- mined the quality of the waveguide. For best results, we found that in this material, 0.4–0.5 mW at the ﬁlm was suit- able to make the desired Gaussian proﬁle with chromophore orientation perpendicular to the waveguide propagation di- rection. The polarization of the laser beam was parallel to the path of the waveguide and the writing speed was 0.1 mm/s. To distinguish the path of the light in the waveguide from the path of light in the ﬁlm, which is called slab guided light, we curved the path of the waveguide in an s-curve manner. By this curving, the waveguide deviated about 700 m from the straight path in a 1.2 cm interval. The light was coupled into the waveguide by a prism coupling technique.\n\nThe proﬁle of the refractive index in waveguides was very important for the number of modes. Because of the Gaussian distribution of the writing laser, the written wave- guide formed a graded index proﬁle in the lateral direction. Figure 3 shows an IR photograph of the light scattered out of the waveguide. The inset in Fig. 3 shows a picture of the waveguide between two cross polarizers observed by a mi- croscope and captured by a digital camera. The width of the waveguide was about 5 m as measured by our polarizing microscope. As shown in the inset, the graded proﬁle of the waveguide was clearly observed.\n\nIn order to measure the waveguide loss, the setup illus- trated in Fig. 4 was used. A 5 mW laser beam with a wave- length of 830 nm was coupled into the waveguide by a prism coupler. The coupled light into the waveguide was found to\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFIG. 4. Schematic diagram for light coupling and loss measurement. The light is coupled into the waveguide by a prism coupler. Another prism is used to out couple light from the waveguide. The intensity of the laser before the coupling prism is 5 mW, about 2% of which enters the wave- guide. Low coupling efﬁciency in prism coupler and narrowness of the waveguide are the main causes of the low coupled light into the waveguide.\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFIG. 5. Measured intensity of the out-coupled light vs distance for 6.5 mm length of the polymeric waveguide.\n\\end{caption}\n\nbe about 2% of the incident laser light. Another prism was used to couple light out of the waveguide which was mea- sured by a large area Si detector. An index matching ﬂuid was used to ensure intimate contact between the prism and the waveguide. The prism was moved along the waveguide at 0.5 mm increments and intensity of out-coupled light was measured at each position.\n\nWe calculated the loss by measuring the intensity of the out-coupled light at different points along the waveguide, ﬁtting them to the absorption exponential and applying the following formula:15\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{array} {l} {{L=\\displaystyle\\frac{-1 0} {x_{2}-x_{1}} \\, \\log\\displaystyle\\frac{I ( x_{2} )} {I ( x_{1} )}=\\displaystyle\\frac{-1 0} {x_{2}-x_{1}} \\, \\log\\displaystyle\\frac{I_{0} e^{-\\alpha x_{2}}} {I_{0} e^{-\\alpha x_{1}}}}} \\\\ {{=\\displaystyle\\frac{1 0 \\alpha} {\\ln( 1 0 )} ( {\\mathrm{d B / c m}} ) \\,,}} \\end{array}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{token}\n2\n\\end{token}\n\nwhere x1 and x2 are two arbitrary positions along the wave- guide, and is the absorption coefﬁcient obtained by ﬁtting the absorption exponential. Results of the measurements are shown in Fig. 5. The output signal from the detector versus distance was plotted from the beginning of the waveguide to the end. The trend of the signal versus distance illustrates a decrease in the intensity due to the loss, as seen in Fig. 5.\n\nThe waveguide path was seen by a charge coupled de- vice CCD camera, as shown in Fig. 3. The scattering cen- ters, obviously visible in Fig. 3, are major contributors to the loss. The smaller centers are most probably due to polymer aggregates, while the larger ones are due to particulates en- tered into the material during the ﬁlm making. Using a wave- guide with less visible scattering centers, was found to be about 0.011 and the average loss along the waveguide was calculated to be 0.48 0.04 dB/cm by applying an exponen- tial ﬁt to the curve of measured intensity.\n\nWe also measured the loss in the ﬁlm without any waveguides slab waveguide . These measurements gave a loss of 1.24 0.13 dB/cm. The larger ﬁgure for the slab guide is due to the lack of the lateral conﬁnement.\n\nWe have fabricated a low loss waveguide using cis- trans-active polymers by a simple “writing” technique with no surface deformation. The method used here can be re- peated easily so we can optimize the parameters of the waveguides. It can also be extended to any polymer contain- ing azo chromophores. In this experiment, we were able to fabricate graded index waveguides with index proﬁle close to the intensity proﬁle of the writing beam which was Gauss- ian. The propagation loss was measured to be 0.48 0.04 dB/cm in the waveguide. The waveguide loss was approximately 2.6 times less than the slab guide. This is due to the lateral conﬁnement and the graded proﬁle of the lateral index. Although the stability of the material is not speciﬁcally tested in this work, these materials are stable under ambient light and are not bleached at all by the guided light. Samples handled in our laboratory from several years ago still have the features “written” on them.\n\nThis work was supported in part by contributions from the Industrial Development and Renovation Organization of Iran, Small Business Development Center SBDC branch.\n\n\\begin{table}\n| 1G.

Introduction\n\\end{title}\n\nPolyimides are typical high performance polymers with high thermal and chemical stability and have been widely used in electric, electronic and aerospace applications. In addition, polyimides with numerous functional groups, such as acidic groups [1], are attracting much attention because they will combine high thermal stability of polyimides and various functionalities. Such functional polyimides will expand the application of polyimides to a wider range of fields.\n\nAs a novel functionality introduced into polyimides, our research group is interested in nitroxyl radicals such as 2,2,6,6- tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO). TEMPO is a stable free radical and known as an oxidation catalyst for primary alcohols [2]. It is also used as a radical scavenger in various chemical reactions. TEMPO is typically used in homogeneous systems, but the immobilization of TEMPO onto solid supports such as polystyrene [3] and silica [4] has also been developed. As polyimides are more thermally stable than polystyrene and more flexible than silica, the development of TEMPO functionalized polyimides will exhibit quite promising results.\n\nTo prepare functionalized polyimides, the A2 + B3 polymerization is one of the suitable methods. It has been known that hyperbranched polymers can be synthesized by a solution polymerization, especially if the A2 monomer is added drop-wise into the B3 monomer solution [5]. Hyperbranched polymers have numerous terminals and TEMPO can be immobilized onto the terminals by an end-capping reaction. On the other hand, the A2 + B3 polymerization also provides a microporous polyimides with a three-dimensional network,\n\nespecially if the polymerization and imidization are performed by one-pot method with high boiling point solvents [6]. Moreover, if one considers polyimide-based materials as solid catalysts, the particle size of polyimides will also be an important property, which can be controlled by the precipitation polymerization method [7-10].\n\nAs mentioned above, in terms of exploring novel solid catalyst materials based on dendritic polyimides, the number of terminal functional groups, porosity, and particle size are important properties. This paper describes three types of polymerizations, 1) one-pot polymerization/ imidization in high boiling point solvents, 2) precipitation polymerization and 3) solution polymerization with a drop-wise feeding method, using the same A2 and B3 monomers, pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and 1,3,5-tris(4- aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB) (Scheme 1). A slightly excess amount PMDA was used to terminate the polymer with phthalic anhydride groups, and the terminals were end-capped with 4-amino-TEMPO to obtain TEMPO functionalized polyimides. The concentration of TEMPO, porosity and morphology of the prepared polymers were characterized by electron spin resonance (ESR), N2 adsorption and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements, respectively.\n\n\\begin{title}\n2. Experimental\n\\end{title}\n\n\\begin{title}\n2.1. Materials\n\\end{title}\n\nPMDA (TCI) was used after sublimation. TAPB (TCI) was used after recrystallization from ethanol. m-Cresol (TCI) and dimethylacetoamide (DMAc, Kanto Chemical) were used after vacuum distillation over calcium hydride. 4-amino-TEMPO (TCI) and all other chemicals are\n\nreagent grade and used as purchased unless otherwise stated.\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nNc1ccc(-c2cc(-c3ccc(N)cc3)cc(-c3ccc(N)cc3)c2)cc1\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nO=c1oc(=O)c2cc3c(=O)oc(=O)c3cc12\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nNC1CC(C)(C)N([O])C(C)(C)C1\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nNC1CC(C)(C)N([O])C(C)(C)C1\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nCC1(C)CC(N)CC(C)(C)N1[O]\n\\end{molecule}\n\nScheme 1. Synthesis of TEMPO functionalized polyimides.\n\n\\begin{title}\n2.2. One-pot polymerization/imidization\n\\end{title}\n\nThis polymerization/imidization was performed following an earlier work with a minor modification [6]. In a 20 mL flask, a solution of TAPB (80.8 mg, 0.23 mmol) in m-cresol (2 mL) was added to a solution of PMDA (100 mg, 0.46 mmol) in m-cresol (3 mL) and stirred under a N2 flow at 0˚C for 2 h. After adding a catalytic amount of isoquinoline at RT, the mixture was stirred at 30˚C for 8 h, 80˚C for 4 h, 160˚C for 4 h, 200˚C for 8 h and 220˚C for 4 h. The precipitated polymer was isolated by filtration and washed with DMF, acetone and THF, and then further stirred in 300 mL of THF at RT overnight. After filtration and drying at 110˚C under vacuum, an yellowish\n\n\\begin{title}\npolyimide powder (PI1) was obtained.\n\\end{title}\n\nIn a 10 mL flask, 4-amino-TEMPO (54.8 mg, 0.32 mmol) and PI1 (50 mg) were stirred in 3 mL of CHCl3 at RT for 12 h. After filtration, the thermal imidization of the terminals was performed at 220˚C under vacuum overnight to obtain a dark brownish powder, PI1-TEMPO-H. PI1-TEMPO- Ch was obtained by performing a chemical imidization instead of the thermal imidization. The powder was stirred in a mixuture of pyridine (1 mL) and acetic anhydride (1 mL) at 100 ˚ C overnight and then filtered. After washing with acetone and drying at RT under vacuum, a dark brownish powder was obtained.\n\n\\begin{title}\n2.3. Precipitation polymerization\n\\end{title}\n\nIn a 10 mL flask, a solution of TAPB (80.8 mg, 0.23 mmol) in acetone (2.6 mL) was added in one-portion to a solution of PMDA (100 mg, 0.46 mmol) in acetone (4.2 mL) at 0˚C under vigorous stirring. After stirring for 2 h, the solvent was removed with a rotary evaporator and a thermal imidization was performed at 220˚C under vacuum for 12 h. The powder was washed with 300 mL of acetone and dried at 110 ˚C under vacuum to obtain a yellowish polyimide powder, (PI2).\n\nThe end-capping reaction with 4-amino-TEMPO followed by the thermal and chemical imidization was peformed in the same manner as mentioned above to obtain PI2-TEMPO-H and PI2-TEMPO-Ch, respectively.\n\n\\begin{title}\n2.4. Solution polymerization\n\\end{title}\n\nIn a 30 mL flask, a solution of TAPB (72.8 mg, 0.21 mmol) in DMAc (7 mL) was added drop-wise over 30 min to a solution of PMDA (100 mg, 0.46 mmol) in DMAc (7 mL) at 0˚C. The mixture was further stirred at RT for 2 h. And then, 4-amino-TEMPO (158 mg, 0.92 mmol) was added and stirred at RT for 3 h. The solution was poured into ethyl acetate and the polymer was collected by filtration. After drying at RT under vacuum, a pinkish powder (PA3-TEMPO) was obtained. As a controlled sample, PA3 was also synthesized without reacting with 4-amino-TEMPO.\n\nThe thermal and chemical imidization of PA3-TEMPO was peformed in the same manner as mentioned above to obtain PI3-TEMPO-H and PI3-TEMPO-Ch, respectively. PI3 was obtained by the chemical imidization of PA3.\n\n\\begin{title}\n2.5. Characterization\n\\end{title}\n\nFT-IR spectra were obtained with a JASCO\n\n4100 spectrometer by the KBr pellet method. SEM was carried out using a VE9800 spectrometer (Keyence). The N2 adsorption was measured using a volumetric adsorption measurement instrument (Bel Japan, Belsorp-mini II). ESR measurement was carried out using a JES-FA100 spectrometer (JEOL) in a powder form. The TEMPO loading was estimated by integrating the ESR spectrum twice and comparing the intensity with relative to that of 4-hydroxy- 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl benzoate (TEMPOB).\n\n\\begin{title}\n3. Results and discussion\n\\end{title}\n\n\\begin{title}\n3.1. One-pot polymerization/imidization\n\\end{title}\n\nPI1 was synthesized by the one-pot polymerization/imidization of TAPB and PMDA in m-cresol and PI1-TEMPO-H and PI1-TEMPO-Ch were prepared by the end-capping reaction for PI1 with 4-amino-TEMPO, followed by the thermal and chemical imidizations, respectively.\n\n\\begin{legend}\nFig. 1.

The particle size seems over 500 nm and the morphology is not uniform. Fig. 2\n\nshows the N2 isotherms with the PI1 based samples. These samples show Type I isotherms in the IUPAC classification, suggesting the presence of microspores. The BET surface areas evaluated from the N2 isotherms are summarized in Table 1. All the PI1 based samples show quite high specific surface areas, which are probably due to three dimensional networks of polyimide.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTable 1. Specific surface area of the PI1 based samples\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{table}\n| Sample       | g BET surface area / m2   |\n|:-------------|:--------------------------|\n| PI1          | 659                       |\n| PI1-TEMPO-H  | 593                       |\n| PI1-TEMPO-Ch | 658                       |\n\\end{table}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFig. 3. FT-IR spectra of the PI1 based samples.\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFig. 4. ESR spectra of the PI1 based samples.\n\\end{caption}\n\nFig. 3 shows the FT-IR spectra of the PI1 based samples. The peaks at 1776 cm-1 (C=O stretch) and 1375 cm-1 (C-N-C stretch) suggest the formation of polyimide. If a polymer contains numerous phthalic anhydride groups, a peak due to the C=O stretch should appear at around 1860 cm-1, but none of these samples showed such peaks. To confirm the existence of nytroxyl radical, ESR\n\nmeasurements were performed and the results are summarized in Fig 4. Compared to the reference sample, TEMOB, none of these three samples showed ESR peaks due to the free radical. It is unlikely that TEMPO group was introduced onto the terminals of PI1.\n\nThese experimental results suggest that the one-pot polymerization/imidization of PMDA and TAPB provides microporous polyimides with a high specific surface area, however the obtained polyimides did not have many terminals because of an excess growth of three dimensional network.\n\n\\begin{title}\n3.2. Precipitation polymerization\n\\end{title}\n\nPI2 was synthesized by the precipitation polymerization of PMDA and TAPB. PI2- TEMPO-H and PI2-TEMPO-Ch were prepared by the end-capping reaction for PI2 with 4-amino- TEMPO, followed by the thermal and chemical imidization, respectively.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFig. 5.

A lot of spherical particles of around 100 nm were observed. Fig. 6 and Table 2\n\nshow the N2 isotherms and the BET surface areas of the PI2 based samples. The isotherms show very little adsorption of N2 except for the macropore region. The BET surface area was in the range of 10-26 m2 g-1.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTable 2.

FT-IR spectra of the PI2 based samples.\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFig. 8. ESR spectra of the PI2 based samples.\n\\end{caption}\n\nFig. 7 shows the FT-IR spectra of the PI2 based samples. The peaks at 1776 cm-1 (C=O stretch) and 1375 cm-1 (C-N-C stretch) suggest the formation of polyimide. In addition, another peak due to C=O stretch appeared at 1860 cm-1, suggesting the presence of phthalic anhydride. Fig. 8 shows the ESR spectra of PI2 based samples. Compared to the reference sample, TEMOB, none of these three samples showed ESR peaks due to the free radical. It is unlikely that TEMPO groups was introduced onto the terminals of PI2.\n\nThese experimental results suggest that the precipitation polymerization provides fine nano-particles of polyimide containing considerable amounts of phthalic anhydride terminal groups but those terminals cannot be functionalized by an end-capping reaction probably because those terminals are hidden in the polymer matrix.\n\n\\begin{title}\n3.3. Solution polymerization\n\\end{title}\n\nPA3 was synthesized by the solution polymerization of PMDA and TAPB in DMAc with a drop-wise feeding method. PA3-TEMPO was prepared by reacting PA with 4-amino-TEMPO in the same flask for the polymerization. PI3-TEMPO-H, PI3-TEMPO-Ch and PI3 were prepared by the thermal imidaization of PA3-TEMPO, the chemical imidization of PA3-TEMPO and the chemical imidization of PA3, respectively.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFig. 9.

The observed polyimide particles\n\nare quite bulky and the morphology is not uniform. Fig. 10 and Table 3 show the N2 isotherms and the BET surface areas of the PI3 based samples. The isotherms show little adsorption of N2 and the BET surface areas were evaluated as less than 1 m2 g-1. This is probably because the morphology of the polyimides are decided at the stage of the reprecipitation.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTable 3.

ESR spectra of the PI3 based samples.\n\\end{caption}\n\nFig. 11 shows the FT-IR spectra of the PI3 based samples. The peaks at 1776 cm-1 (C=O stretch) and 1375 cm-1 (C-N-C stretch) and the absence of amide derived peak at 1655 cm-1 (C=O stretch) suggest the formation of polyimide for PI3-TEMPO-H, PI3-TEMPO-Ch and PI3. Fig. 12 shows the ESR spectra of the PI3 based samples.\n\nPA3-TEPMO and PI3-TEMO-Ch clearly show ESR signals due to nitroxyl radical. The concentration of nitroxyl radical was evaluated as approximately 1.2 mmol g-1, based on a comparison against the reference spectrum of TEMPO-B. If one considers an ideal hyperbranched structure from the current A2 + B3 monomer and fully functionalized terminals, the theoretical value will be 1.13 mmol g-1. Therefore, the structure of PI3 is probably quite close to a hyperbranched structure rather than a network structure. In contrast, PI3-TEMPO-H did not show any clear ESR signal. This is probably because the TEMPO structure decomposed by the thermal imidization procedure.\n\nThese experimental results suggest that a TEMPO functionalized polyimide has been successfully synthesized by a solution polymerization of PMDA and TAPB with a drop-wise feeding method, followed by an in-situ end-capping reaction with 4-amino-TEMPO. Further studies will be done to perform the optimization of morphology, introduction of different functionalities and catalysis utilizing this series of functionalized polyimides.\n\n\\begin{title}\n4. Conclusion\n\\end{title}\n\nThree different polymerization methods were studied for the A2 + B3 polymerization to provide a TEMPO functionalized polyimides. The one-pot polymerization/imidization and the precipitation polymerization provided a microporous polyimide and a spherical polyimide, respectively; however, the functionalization of the terminals was difficult. In contrast, the solution polymerization with a drop-wise feeding method provided a hyperbranched polyimides and the terminals have been successfully functionalized with TEMPO by\n\nthe in-situ end-capping reaction. This polymerization and end-capping method will be applicable for the introduction of other various functionalities and might result in the development of various novel polyimide materials.\n\n\\begin{title}\nAcknowledgement\n\\end{title}\n\nM.

How- ever, the high performance of heat resistance and dielectric properties are quite difficult to achieve all together due to their mutual implication. Here, by intensively investigating the correlation between molecular structure and properties, polyimide dielectrics with i) enhanced dielectric constant by introducing sulfonyl group, ii) low dissipation factor by introducing flex- ible linkage, and iii) high Tg (glass transition temperature) by retaining an aromatic structure, are obtained. The sulfonyl-containing polyimides with different flexible linkages exhibit simultaneously a high dielectric constant (4.50–5.98), low dissipation factor (0.00298–0.00426), and outstanding break- down strength (most above 500 MV m−1), as well as superior heat resistance (Tg: 244–304 °C). Specifically, the polyimide (SPI-1) with sulfonyl group in diamine moiety and para-para linkage shows stable dielectric properties up to 150 °C, and the discharged energy density and charge–discharge efficiency can be as high as 7.04 J cm−3 and 91.3% at 500 MV m−1, respectively.\n\nHeat resistant polymer dielectrics are urgently required for high-temperature film capacitors in the applications of avionic and automotive industries, underground oil and gas explora- tion, and advanced propulsion systems.[1,2] Compared to ceramic dielectrics, polymer dielectrics exhibit low dissipation factor, high dielectric strength, excellent mechanical flexibility, and easy manufacture behavior.[3–6] The state-of-the-art polymer dielec- tric is biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP), which displays superior high breakdown strength (700 MV m−1), very low dis- sipation factor (0.0002) but relatively low dielectric constant\n\nDr. H.

Among them, polyimides are a class of polymers that contain polar CONCO rings in molecular structures, with the nature of advanced heat resistance, superior mechanical properties, reasonably low dissipation factor, and high dielectric break- down strength.[27–29] However, the dielectric constant of poly- imide is not high enough for high energy density film capacitor applications.[30,31] Introduction of polar groups into molecular structure can improve this parameter, but it would also likely deteriorate the other properties. For example, dielectric con- stant was enhanced from 2.9 to 4.9 (at 190 °C and 1 kHz) when highly polar nitrile dipoles were attached to the main chains, and to 5.5–7.2 when bipyridine units were brought into back- bone of polyimides, while their dissipation factor was increased to a high level of 0.04–0.08 due to the difficulty of frictionless dipole switching.[32–35] Dielectric constant of 7.8 and maximum energy density of 15 J cm−3 was achieved from polyimides pre- pared from aromatic dianhydrides and aliphatic diamines with polar groups of O, C(O) in molecular structures, while\n\n(2.2) and limited operating temperature (105 °C).[7–12] Therefore, developing high- temperature resistant polymeric dielectrics with high dielectric constant, low dissipa- tion factor, and high breakdown strength is essential for next generation film capacitors in harsh environmental applications.[13]\n\nSo far, most studies about dielectric polymers aiming to the applications of film capacitors are focused on composites by introducing fillers into polymer matrix to improve the dielectric constant.[14–17] However, the limitation is obvious due to the complex synthesis, still low breakdown field, and high dissipation factor. Recently, some efforts have been directed to the molecular design of dielectric polymer to optimize its properties. For instance, in the article by Ramprasad et al.,[18] it was pointed out both computationally and experimentally that polymers with polar units, for example, NH, CO, O,\n\nthe heat resistance was sacrificed (Tg = 53–174 °C) owing to the aliphatic moieties.[24] Therefore, high temperature resistance polymer with high breakdown strength, high dielectric con- stant, and low dissipation factor are quite difficult to achieve simultaneously.\n\nIn this work, strong polar sulfonyl group with high dipole moment (4.30 D) and different flexible linkages between ben- zene groups in various configurations were introduced into polyimide chains to achieve enhanced dipole density plus more “effective” dipoles, and closely reach to frictionless dipole reori- entation, thereby high dielectric constant and low dissipation factor were realized simultaneously without sacrificing heat resistance. The correlation between molecular structure and dielectric properties was explained in detail. It is worth noting that the methodology for molecular tailoring and the corre- lating mechanism of molecular structure and dielectric proper- ties is also applicable to the design of other polymer dielectrics.\n\nA series of sulfonyl-containing polyimide (SPI) films were prepared, and their chemical structures were identified by FT-IR (see Figure S1, Supporting Information). These SPIs dis- played outstanding thermal stability based on the TGA results which revealed the polyimides can be stable up to 500 °C without obvious weight loss (Table 1). Also excellent heat resist- ance was obtained according to their superior high glass tran- sition temperature (Tg) ranging from 244 to 304 °C (Table 1). By carefully analyzing the Tg results, it was found the Tg values are closely related to polymeric rigidity. For instance, SPI-1 and SPI-2 are positional isomers with the para–para and meta–meta linkage in diamine moiety, respectively. SPI-1 with more rigid para–para linkage showed higher Tg value than its isomers with meta–meta structure, SPI-2. Similar results were observed for SPI-4 and SPI-5. In another example, SPI-1 and SPI-3 are posi- tional isomers in which sulfonyl and ether groups exchange positions in their repeating-unit structures, higher Tg value was observed from SPI-3 which has higher chain stiffness due to the fact that sulfonyl group in the bulky dianhydride moiety increased the difficulty of segmental rotation.\n\nDielectric properties of SPIs were evaluated in terms of die- lectric constant (relative dielectric constant here, εr), dissipation factor (tan δ) at different frequencies and temperatures, and Weibull breakdown strength (Eb) at room and elevated tempera- tures. In addition, the high electrical field dielectric property\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTable 1.  Heat resistance and dielectric properties of sulfonyl-containing polyimides.\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{table}\n| PIs   | Cd)   | T 1   | ε,   | tan 8)   | Ed) [MV m−]   | Ue,max [ cm-³3}   |\n|:------|:------|:------|:-----|:---------|:--------------|:------------------|\n| SP1-1 | 290   | 541   | 5.98 | 0.00373  | 536           | 7.60              |\n| SP1-2 | 244   | 513   | 5.48 | 0.00392  | 548           | 7.28              |\n| SP1-3 | 304   | 578   | 5.08 | 0.00397  | 533           | 6.39              |\n| SP1-4 | 250   | 569   | 4.60 | 0.00378  | 419           | 3.58              |\n| SP1-5 | 271   | 513   | 4.66 | 0.00298  | 361           | 2.69              |\n| SPI-6 | 302   | 570   | 4.50 | 0.00426  | 569           | 6.45              |\n| SP1-7 | 278   | 586   | 5.33 | 0.00371  | 501           | 5.92              |\n\\end{table}\n\na)Determined by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA); b)onset decomposition tem- perature; c)at 103 Hz and room temperature; d)at room temperature.\n\nwas obtained by electric displacement–electric field (D-E) characterization.\n\nIn Table 1, with the presence of sulfonyl group in each repeating unit, the dielectric constants of different SPIs at room temperature ranged from 4.50 to 5.98 which are much higher than BOPP (2.2) and conventional polyimide (i.e., Kapton, about 3.5).[8] As it is known that for amorphous polar macromolecules, dipolar polarization (consisting of dipole moment and volumetric dipole density) is the major contrib- utor for dielectric constant. Thus, for SPIs, the polar sulfonyl group (SO2) with a quite high dipole moment of 4.30 D in the backbones combined with considerable dipole density (one SO2 group (SPI-1 to SPI-6) or two SO2 groups (SPI-7) in each repeating unit) in the polyimide dielectrics are responsible for the high dielectric constant. Besides that, the SO2 con- taining structure that is linked with phenyl groups in diamine (SPI-1, SPI-2) moieties is proposed to having greater mobility, that is, more “effective” dipoles as compared to that connected to bulkier benzene-imide rings in dianhydride (SPI-3 to SPI- 7), resulting in SPI-1 and SPI-2 with larger dielectric constant values. Furthermore, the para–para linked SPI-1 proved higher dielectric constant than the meta–meta counterpart (SPI-2) due to the fact that SPI-1 has more symmetrical structure and lower energy barrier in free rotation which would aid the alignment of dipoles in alternating electric field. In addition, SPI-3 exhib- ited higher dielectric constant due to the shorter repeating unit with higher SO2 density compared with SPI-4 and SPI-5 which have similar molecular structures. The lowest εr value was observed in SPI-6 with the weakest polar group of meth- ylene in diamine moiety. While for SPI-7, which has the highest dipole density (two SO2 groups in each repeating unit), the dielectric constant was not as high as expected. This is prob- ably because the two relatively rigid SO2 groups instead of O and SO2 groups in the main chain enhanced the overall chain stiffness, resulting in the hindrance of dipole rota- tion. Thus, besides dipole moment and dipole density, “effec- tive” dipole is another important factor to affect the value of the dielectric constant.\n\nIn other dielectric properties of dissipation factor, all the SPIs showed basically similar and low tan δ value of no more than 0.00426 at room temperature and 103 Hz (Table 1). Based on the XRD pattern (see Figure S2, Supporting Information), the amorphous nature indicated the effective reduction of the long-range dipolar coupling among strong polar structures (e.g., the SO2 moieties and characteristic imide group), so as to decrease tan δ value.[19] Also, low dissipation factors were achieved as the temperature is much lower than the glass tran- sition temperature and the main chains are frozen (only small unit can rotate). In addition, it is worth to note SPI-5 exhibited the lowest tan δ due to its larger proportion of flexible ether structure (O) and symmetrical para–para linkage.\n\nIn Figure 1a, as the frequency (f) increases, dielectric con- stants of SPIs decreased slightly because the dipoles cannot catch up with the oscillation of alternating electric field. All the SPIs achieved their relaxation peaks at the frequency around 105–106 Hz. Several conclusions could be drawn from the results of tan δ versus f spectra. i) In the full frequency range, SPI-1 with more symmetric structure that facilitates dipole ori- entation displayed lower tan δ value than its isomer of SPI-2.\n\n\\begin{legend}\n(a)\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\n(b)\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 1.  a) Dielectric constant and dissipation factor of SPI-1 to SPI-7 at R.T.; b) dielectric constant and dissipation factor of SPI-1 at elevated temperature.\n\\end{caption}\n\nii) It is obvious that SPI-5 and SPI-7 showed very close dissipa- tion factors when their frequency was lower than 103 Hz. As the frequency rose above 103 Hz, SPI-5, with a more flexible ether linkage and symmetric structure, still kept a relatively low tan δ value. While for SPI-7 having meta–meta linked Ph2SO2 (mDS) with more restricted segmental mobility, the more restricted dipoles lagged behind the alternating electric field, resulting in higher dissipation factor. iii) The other SPIs showed similar dissipation performance due to the analogous restriction of dipole switching.\n\nTo evaluate dielectric property dependence on temperatures, SPI-1 with the best performance was chosen to do tempera- ture-scan broadband dielectric spectrometer (BDS) at different frequencies as shown in Figure 1b. At a given temperature,\n\nstant and second highest breakdown strength demonstrate to give the greatest maximum energy storage density.\n\nA bipolar D-E analysis was carried out to investigate the dielectric properties of SPI-1 under high electric field (R.T., 1 Hz). The extremely narrow D-E loop (Figure 2a) further con- firmed its low dissipation factor. As electric field increases, the D-E loop becomes slightly wider. More dipoles would take part in orientation at higher electric field therefore larger restric- tion and dielectric dissipation occurred. The apparent dielec- tric constant under high field calculated from the D-E loop within ±100 MV m−1 (εr = D/(ε0E)) can achieve up to 6.49, which is higher than the result form BDS measurement at low electric field (εr = 5.98). This is because higher electric field can help polarize excess dipoles which is difficult to occur in\n\ndielectric constant progressively declined with frequency increased from 10 to 106 Hz. Under different frequencies, the dielectric constants of SPI-1 are almost constant at temperature range above 100 °C and stable up to 150 °C. This is much different compared to BOPP whose max- imum operating temperature is no more than 105 °C. There is a weak broad peak at tempera- ture range around 50 °C which may be originated from adsorbed water as pointed out in some research.[36] Similar high temperature stability tendency was found for the dissipation factor at the temperature range from 100 to 150 °C. But at lower temperature range (i.e., −50 to 100 °C), the sub-Tg transitions shifted to higher temperature as frequency increased because more energy was needed for dipoles rotating under the applied electric field with higher frequency.\n\nAt room temperature, breakdown strength of all SPIs ranged from 361 MV m−1 to 569 MV m−1 (Table 1 and Figure S3a, Sup- porting Information). Among them, SPI-1 and SPI-3 indicated very close Eb value on account of their isomeric structures that have the sulfonyl and ether groups in the exchanging places of diamine and dianhydride segments. SPI-4 and SPI-5 exhibited lower Eb due to the longer π–π conjugating from long-chain phenyl structure facilitating the smooth electronic conductance path. Take the SPI-1 as example, its Weibull breakdown strength showed great thermal sta- bility with slight decline from 536 to 468 MV m−1 at the temperature range from room tempera- ture to 150 °C (Figure S3b, Supporting Informa- tion). The energy density can be calculated from the simplified equation\n\n\\begin{title}\nU 0.5 E e r 0 b 2 ε ε =\n\\end{title}\n\nfor the linear dielectrics, where Ue is the energy density, εr is relative dielectric constant, ε0 is the constant of 8.854 × 10−12 F m−1, and Eb is the breakdown strength.[37,38] The maximum Ue of different SPIs is listed in Table 1, from 2.69 to 7.60 J cm−3.

As shown in Figure 2b, the discharged density (extracted from Figure 2a) can be as high as 7.04 J cm−3, which is about 2.3 times of BOPP film (i.e., 3.0 J cm−3 at 550 MV m−1). This is similar with the calculated result from Equation (1). The charge–discharge efficiency can reach up to 91.3% even at 500 MV m−1 owing to its low dissipation factor. A better overall performance is obtained compared to some typical linear polymer dielectrics as sum- marized in Table 2. For example, SPI-1 exhibited higher energy efficiency than the polythiourea (e.g., PDTC-HDA, about 0.7 at 700 MV m−1), lower dissipation factor than the polyureas and polyurethanes (0.00758– 0.0429), better heat resistance than the semi- aromatic polyimide (e.g., BTDA-HK511, Tg = 78 °C).[18,21,22,24]\n\nA series of sulfonyl-containing aromatic polyimides exhibiting high heat resistance and remarkable dielectric properties simul- taneously were prepared and investigated. The glass transition temperature of the SPIs ranged from 244–304 °C, and the decomposi- tion temperature was above 500 °C. Particu- larly, the SPIs presented dielectric constant of 4.50–5.98, dissipation factor of 0.00298– 0.00426, Weibull breakdown strength of 361– 569 MV m−1, and the calculated maximum energy density of 2.69–7.60 J cm−3. It proved that high dipole moment polar sulfonyl structure together with high dipole density, moderate flexible structure, and the retained aromatic structure in polyimides are respon- sible for the excellent heat resistance and dielectric properties. In addition, for the poly- imide (SPI-1) with sulfonyl group in diamine moiety with para–para linkage, its dielectric properties was stable up to 150 °C, the dis- charged energy density and charge–discharge efficiency can be as high as 7.04 J cm−3 and 91.3% at 500 MV m−1, respectively. There- fore, the sulfonyl-containing polyimide dielectrics are promising candidate for next generation film capacitors in harsh environ- mental applications.\n\n\\begin{title}\nExperimental Section\n\\end{title}\n\nMaterials: 3,3′,4,4′-Diphenylsulfonyl tetracarboxylic dianhydride (DSDA), 4,4′-oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA), 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl sulfonyl (pDS), 3,3′-diaminodiphenyl sulfonyl (mDS) were purchased from TCI Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd and used as received. 4,4′-Diaminodiphenyl ether (ODA), 1,3-bis(4-aminophenoxy) benzene (134APB), 1,4-bis(4- aminophenoxy) benzene (144APB), and 4,4′-diamino diphenylmethane (MDA) were purchased from Aladdin reagent corporation.

In a typical experiment, SPI-1, which derived from ODPA and pDS, was prepared from the following procedure. pDS (2.4830 g, 0.01 mol) and ODPA (3.1021 g, 0.01 mol) were added to 22.3 g solvent of DMAc under inert atmosphere and the mixture was reacted for 12 h at ambient temperature. The polyamic acid (PAA) solution was obtained afterward. Then the PAA solution was casted into wet film with the blade gap of 200 µm. Imidization occurred while thermally baking in an oven at 100 °C for 2 h, 150 °C for 1 h, 250 °C for 1 h, and 350 °C for 0.5 h. The free-standing polyimide films with the thickness of 10–20 µm was obtained by immersing the glass plate in water followed by drying in an oven in vacuum at 100 °C overnight.\n\nInstrumentation: Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with TA instruments TGA Q500 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under O2 atmosphere. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was performed with TA instruments DMA Q800 at heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Dielectric constant and dissipation factor were investigated by a Novocontrol broadband dielectric spectrometer (BDS, Germany). Silver electrodes of 20 mm diameter and 60 nm thickness were evaporated on both sides of the sample through a physical vapor deposition method. For frequency scans, samples were held at constant temperature and a sine voltage of 1.0 Vrms was applied across the samples with frequency ranging from 10 to 106 Hz. For temperature scans, temperature was programmed to change from −50 to 150 °C at a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1. Temperature spectrometer at 10, 102, 103, 104, 105, and 106 Hz were recorded. Dielectric breakdown strength measurements were performed on a breakdown instrument (CS9920B, China) using the electrostatic pull-down method under a direct-current voltage ramp of 500 V s−1. High-field electric displacement-electric field (D-E) loop was collected using a modified Sawyer-Tower circuit, where the samples were subject to a triangular bipolar wave with a frequency of 10 Hz.\n\n\\begin{title}\nSupporting Information\n\\end{title}\n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or from the author.\n\n\\begin{legend}\nODPA\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nDSDA\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nSPI-1:ODPA-pDS\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nSPI-5:DSDA-144APB\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nCS(C)(=O)=O\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nR2\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nSPI-2: ODPA-mDS\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nSPI-6: DSDA-MDA\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nmDS\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nODA\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nCc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)c2ccc(C)cc2)cc1\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nCc1cccc(S(=O)(=O)c2cccc(C)c2)c1\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nCc1ccc(Oc2ccc(C)cc2)cc1\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nSPI-3: DSDA-ODA\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nSPI-7:DSDA-mDS\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{title}\nAcknowledgements\n\\end{title}\n\nThis research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grants No.: 2016YFB0100600).\n\n\\begin{title}\nConflict of Interest\n\\end{title}\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\n\\begin{title}\nKeywords\n\\end{title}\n\ndielectric properties, heat resistance, sulfonyl-containing polyimides\n\nReceived: November 19, 2018 Revised: January 14, 2019 Published online:\n\n[1] Q.

Purpose of the development was the application to the interlayer dielectric of dual metal semiconductor device. By coating liquid PI precursor on a stepped first Al wiring layer, flat PI insulating layer is obtained and step-free second Al layer can be formed as shown in Fig. 1. As a result, reliability of the electrode, especially the second level electrode, is remarkably improved.\n\nResult of high temperature and high humidity life test of the PI intercon­ nect ICs is shown in Fig. 2 (2). Time to reach to 1% cummulative failure is about 10 years under 65 °C-95%RH condition. This life is comparable with the PSG (phosphorous doped silica glass) passivated single layer device.\n\nIn this way high reliability of PI interconnect ICs was confirmed in the market, and application of PI to microelectronics rapidly expanded. Fig. 3 summarizes the application of PIs to microelectronics in chronological order (3). They include α-ray shield of memory device, interlayer insulation of thin film facsimile thermal head, thin film magnetic head and so forth. Out of these applications, this paper introduces the recent progress of the application to LSI, Liquid Crystal Display, Multi Chip Module and Optical Wave Guide.\n\n\\begin{title}\nPI BUFFER COAT\n\\end{title}\n\nMounting method of semiconductor package to printed wiring board is shifting from pin inserting to surface mounting. In a surface mount, soldering is carried out by dipping the package in a molten solder or exposing to high temperature gas, vapor phase soldering. During this process mold stress generates in a package because of the difference of thermal expansion of mold resin and semiconductor chip. This mold stress gives fatal damage to the package such as passivation crack, Al electrode slide and package crack. Accordingly, it is a very\n\n\\begin{title}\n0097-6156/94/0537-0380$06.75/0 © 1994 American Chemical Society\n\\end{title}\n\nIn Polymers for Microelectronics; Thompson, L., et al.; ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 1993.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 1.

For this purpose, coating the surface of the chip by PI is currently remarked and utilized in the industry.\n\n\\begin{title}\nPrevention of Passivation Crack\n\\end{title}\n\nFig. 4 compares the humidity resistance of the package of PSG passivated chip dipped in solder with non dipped sample (4). Failure rate of solder dipped package is higher. However, when 2 fim thick PI (PIQ:PMDA/BTDA/ODA/ Diaminodiphenylether carbonamide) film was coated on the PSG passivation, failure rate was remarkably improved to the equivalent value to non dipped package as shown in Fig. 5 (4).\n\nRole of PI chip coat film can be explained as follows. In a case of PSG passivation alone, cracks are generated in the PSG film by the mold stress because of the brittleness of PSG film, and A l electrode corrodes by the moisture penetrating through these cracks. On the other hand, for a package with PI chip coat, mold stress is absorbed by this PI film and the passivation crack is prevented.\n\nFig. 6 compares the passivation crack for various PI chip coat (5). PI-A is low thermal expansion, PI-B is low modulus and PI-C is conventional (Hereafter conventional PI refers to PMDA/ODA PI unless otherwise specified). Among them, low modulus PI-B coating gives the best result. This can be explained by its big stress absorbing ability. On the other hand, relatively good preventing effect is observed for PI-A, which has the highest modulus. In this case stress generation is suppressed by the smaller difference of coefficient of thermal expansion between PI and passivation film. Namely, both PI-A and -B have an ability to prevent passivation crack but their function is different. This can be understood by the fact that stress is proportional to the product of the difference of coefficient of thermal expansion of PI film and substrate and modulus of PI film.\n\nIn some cases mold stress affects the active area of the device. Table 1 shows the effect of PI chip coat on the threshold voltage shift of Bipolar Interface Device having piezosensitive circuit (6). By applying 12 fim thick PI coat, threshold failure rate decreases from 10 to 0 %. PI plays an important role to stabilize the electrical property of the circuit by relaxing the mold stress.\n\n\\begin{title}\nPrevention of Electrode Slide\n\\end{title}\n\nAl electrode in a chip can slide by the mold stress during heat cycle. Effect of PI chip coat on Al slide is shown in Table 2 (5). No Al slide was observed for both low thermal expansion and low stress Pis compared to the large Al slide for non-coated device. Thus, PI coating is also effective to Al slide by absorbing the stress generated by heat cycle.\n\n\\begin{title}\nPrevention of Package Crack\n\\end{title}\n\nRecently, so called package crack attracts attention.

Table 3 summarizes the mode of package crack and the factors affecting the cracks. There are three kinds of package crack. Top crack occurs from the delamination between mold resin and chip surface. Bottom crack from the delamination between mold resin and back side of die pad. Side crack relates to die attaching material.\n\nFig. 7 shows a mechanism of bottom package crack induced by the vapor pressure (7). Moisture trapped between die pad and mold resin evaporates in the soldering process. From this mechanism, it is thought to be possible to prevent crack by the improvement of adhesion between die pad and mold resin. By forming a thick PI film on the back side of die pad as shown in Fig. 8, occurrence of package crack was investigated. Results are shown in Table 4 (8). By forming PI layer, package crack can be depressed, but it depends on the type of PI. Of these Pis, PI-B which has good adhesion, T g higher than soldering temperature, 260 °C, and low moisture absorption rate shows the best result.\n\nNext example is the prevention of top crack by coating PI on a chip surface. Table 5 shows the number of cracked package for various PI coated and non coated device after moisture absorption followed by vapor phase soldering and heat cycle (9). Cracking can be drastically suppressed by forming PI chip coat. No remarkable difference was observed among Pis, but big difference was observed between molding compound A and B. Observing the interface of chip and molding compound, delamination was found for the cracked package. Namely, top crack can be prevented by improving the adhesion between molding compound and chip by PI chip coating and selection of molding compound.\n\n\\begin{title}\nRequired Properties of PI for Chip Coat Application\n\\end{title}\n\nAs so far described, PI chip coat is effective to prevent damages to the package during soldering or heat cycle. Table 6 summarizes the required properties of PI for chip coat. These values can be deduced from the reliability data mentioned above. Table 7 shows the 5 step ranking of various types of Pis for these properties. Conventional and fluorinated Pis show the balanced prop- erties but the stress is rather high. Low modulus PI has low T g and high moisture absorption. There is a problem of low adhesive property in low thermal expan- sion PI. If the adhesion of low thermal expansion PI can be improved by a certain method, it must be the best fit material.\n\nReliability of chip coated device is strongly affected by the adhesion of mold resin and PI film. Mechanism of the adhesion of mold resin and PI and the method to improve it will be introduced in the following. Fig. 9 is a typical viscoelastic spectrum of PI (10). j8 dispersion due to the localized motion of the molecular chain is observed at around 130 °C. Relation between adhesive strength and /3 dispersion temperature is shown in Fig. 10 (10). Good correla- tion is observed between them. The lower the /3 dispersion temperature, the higher the adhesion. Especially, when p temperature exceeds the curing temper- ature of mold resin, 180 °C in this case, the adhesive strength drastically drops. This means that, in order to obtain high adhesion, stress of PI has to be relaxed\n\n\\begin{title}\nIn Polymers for Microelectronics; Thompson, L., et al.;\n\\end{title}\n\nACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 1993.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTable 3.

In other words, PI having dispersion temperature lower than curing temperature shows good adhesion to the mold resin.\n\nBut some Pis such as low thermal expansion PI has no or very high )3 dispersion temperature and no stress relaxation is expected. In such a case, it is expected that the PI surface treatment is effective from the analogy of the improvement of PI-PI adhesion. By treating the PI surface by N 2 or O z ashing, contact angle decreased and good adhesion was obtained as shown in Table 8 (ii). By the plasma treatment PI surface is roughened. Anchoring effect may also be the factor to enhance the adhesive strength. In conclusion, poor adhesion of low thermal expansion PI can be improved by the plasma treatment, and low thermal expansion PI is the most promising material for the chip coat applica- tion.\n\n\\begin{title}\nA P P L I C A T I O N T O M U L T I C H I P M O D U L E ( M C M )\n\\end{title}\n\nPI has began to be applied to multi chip module, which can reduce the machine cycle of computer. Cross section of typical MCM is shown in Fig. 11 (12). 5 layers of metallization insulated by 15 to 20 fim thick PI film is formed on ceramic wiring board. Table 9 is the results of the evaluation of various Pis for MCM (13). Among them, low stress PI, namely low thermal expansion PI, seems to be best balanced except for adhesion and planarity. In the following, recent works to improve these properties of low thermal expansion PI will be intro- duced.\n\nIn MCM there exists three adhesion interfaces, metal on PI, PI on PI and PI on metal as shown in Fig. 12. Among them adhesion of PI on metal is sufficient. Fig. 13 compares the adhesive strength of conventional PI, PIQ, and low thermal expansion PI, L-100, for various metals (14). Adhesion of low thermal expansion PI is extremely low. But, as shown in Fig. 14, by treating the PI surface by oxygen, CF4 or nitrogen gas plasma, high adhesion can be obtained for Cu and Ti, which shows poor adhesion when untreated (14). Among the gases nitrogen is most effective. Reason of the improvement of adhesion by nitrogen plasma was investigated by the surface analysis using ESCA (14). Imide group decomposes to produce more active group such as amide and amino as shown in Fig. 15. These groups are thought to work to improve adhesion.\n\nThe second interface, PI-PI adhesion is also able to be improved by either oxygen plasma or Ar sputtering of PI surface as shown in Fig. 16. PI-PI adhesion is influenced by the baking atmosphere. Fig. 17 shows the experimental results of the dependence of the baking atmosphere on the adhesion (15). By baking in nitrogen atmosphere high adhesion is maintained under high humid condition for PI-C, low thermal expansion PI.\n\nPlanarity of PI film is affected by the solid content of PI precursor. Good planarity can be obtained for high solid content varnish as shown in Fig. 18 (16). However, usually, high solid content means high viscosity and gives the ununi- formity of the resultant film. Most effective method to obtain low viscosity varnish with high solid content is to decrease molecular weight by using capped monomer such as half ester of acid dianhydride. Liquid properties of PI precursor obtained by ester oligomer method is shown in Table 10 (16).\n\n\\begin{title}\nIn Polymers for Microelectronics; Thompson, L., et al.;\n\\end{title}\n\nACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 1993.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTable 8.

When PI precursor is baked in contact with Cu, its properties deteriorates as shown in Table 11. This deterioration is explained by the decomposition of imide ring as a result of the reaction of migrated Cu ion and carboxyl group of polyamic acid (27). So it is necessary to cover Cu wire by another metal such as Cr or to use preimidized PI instead of polyamic acid.\n\nTable 12 is a summary of selection of PI and processing in M C M applica- tion. Low thermal expansion PI is most promising. Future subject is etching. 0 2 -RIE is most suitable from the point of fine patterning but the etching time is too long for the production line. Therefore, photosensitive low thermal expan- sion PI seems to be most promising for MCM application, hopefully preimidized in order to prevent the reaction with Cu, and positive working to get high accurate patterning.\n\n\\begin{title}\nAPPLICATION TO LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY (LCD)\n\\end{title}\n\nIn LCD picture image is obtained through the change of the transmission of light by orienting the liquid crystal molecule under the electrical field (Fig. 19). The orientation of liquid crystal is controlled by the alignment surface, and PI is dominantly utilized for this purpose. One of the advantages of PI is to be able to control the pretilt angle. As shown in Fig. 20 pretilt angle is defined as an angle between liquid crystal molecule and alignment surface under the absence of electrical field. This pretilt angle is produced by rubbing the surface of PI. If this pretilt angle is not constant throughout the panel, orientation of liquid crystal is dispersed and gives an ununiform image.\n\nFig. 21 shows the relation between surface tension of alignment surface and pretilt angle for two kinds of Pis (18). Pretilt angle increases with the decrease of surface tension. [Usually pretilt angle increases with the increase of surface tension. This result seems to be the mistyping of the original paper]. However, for PI containing long alkyl chain, pretilt angle increases drastically. This indicates that pretilt angle is also affected by the physical structure of the surface.\n\nPis having various methylene chain length were synthesized using alkyl chain containing diamine, and the relation between chain length and pretilt angle was investigated (19). Results are shown in Fig. 22. Low pretilt angle is obtained for odd carbon number PI, and high pretilt angle for even number PI. This phenomenon can be interpreted from the difference of the conformations of Pis as shown in Fig. 23 (19). Assuming that PI is oriented to rubbing direction, PI using odd carbon number diamine has cis conformation. If liquid crystal molecule is adsorbed to alkyl chain no pretilt angle is produced.

Structure of fluorinated Pis designed for optical wave guide applica- tion.\n\nIn Polymers for Microelectronics; Thompson, L., et al.; ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 1993.\n\n\\begin{title}\nAPPLICATION TO OPTICAL WAVE GUIDE (OWG)\n\\end{title}\n\nOptical wave guide which is used in the opto-electronic packaging composes of core and cladding and when refractive index of core is higher than cladding light progresses in the core as shown in Fig. 24. PI optical wave guide has been extensively studied (20, 21) since PI stands better for soldering temperature and various circumstances than PMMA or polycarbonate.\n\nPI for optical wave guide must have a high transmittancy to the light. Fluorinated PI is known to be transparent to the visible light. Fig. 25 shows the two types of fluorinated Pis (22). Properties of these Pis are shown in Table 14. In order that light progresses in a core without leaking to cladding, refractive index difference should be greater than 0.005 to 0.01. At the same time, since cladding and core are fabricated as an unit, their properties are required to be similar. By changing the mole ratio of 6FDA and PMDA as shown in Fig. 26 (22), it is possible to design two kinds of Pis, one for core and one for cladding, with different refractive index and similar properties.\n\n\\begin{title}\nCONCLUSION\n\\end{title}\n\nSo far the recent activities on the application of PI to microelectronics are reviewed and the following conclusion can be obtained.\n\n(1) To add new functions is required to PI with the spread of the applica- tion of PI to microelectronics.\n\n(2) PI chip coat is effective for the prevention of passivation crack, Al slide and package crack of semiconductor devices. Low thermal expansion PI can be regarded as the most suitable material for this application.\n\n(3) Low thermal expansion PI is also the most appropriate material for MCM application. But it has disadvantages in adhesion, planarity and reaction with Cu, which can be improved by the chemistry of PI, processing and wire structure.\n\n(4) PI plays an important role as an alignment surface of STN and TFT LCDs. Pretilt angle can be controlled by introducing alkyl chain to PI backbone. At the present stage preimidized varnish reacted from alkyl chain containing diamine and cycloaliphatic dianhydride seems to be most promising.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTable 14.

Monomer diamines with siloxane units were prepared by three steps, which include Williamson’s synthesis, hydrosilylation, and reduction. The polymerization was conducted by the conventional method, solution polymerization, followed by thermal imidization. A highly viscose poly(amic acid) solution was obtained and its inherent viscosities were 0.65-1.73 dL/g. These novel polyimides exhibited high thermal stability and a lower crystal-LC transition temperature compared to reported polyimides containing alkylene or oxyethylene spacer units. X-ray studies were performed for investigating the oriented smectic mesophases of each polyimide. In the polyimides derived from PMDA, a smectic A (SmA) phase was formed on gradual cooling from the isotropic liquid phase. On the other hand, the polyimides based on BPDA formed a smectic C (SmC) phase as well as a SmA phase.\n\n\\begin{title}\nIntroduction\n\\end{title}\n\nRecent integration, miniaturization, and high functionaliza- tion in electronics are rapidly progressing, where both conductors and insulating materials have been packaged as densely as possible. The low thermal conductivity of insulating polymers yields a large temperature rise and gradient in devices that causes electric connection failure and reduces the lifetime of these devices. Therefore, thermoconductive polymers which canrelease generated heat effectively are required in semiconductors as electric insulators. To increase thermal conductivity, highly oriented polymers, that is, liquid crystalline (LC) polymers, are effective candidates.1 The alignments of LC polymers are con- trolled in common ways, such as stretching, rubbing, the mag- netic field, and self-alignment.2-5\n\nAromatic polyimides are promising materials for the applica- tions to aerospace and electronic devices due to their excellent physical and chemical properties, that is, they have outstanding thermal and chemical stabilities, mechanical properties, electrical properties, and radiation resistance.6,7 Next-generation poly- meric insulators with high thermal conductivity required rela- tively low phase transition temperatures and low elasticresistance for easy processing. Thus, LC polyimides possessing flexible spacer units are good candidates. A few LC polyimides with sequences of methylene or ethylene oxide units in the main chains have been reported, such as thermotropic LC polyimides with methylene units (8-12) from a special tetracarboxylic dian- hydride, 4,400-terphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride and aliphatic diamines,8-10 and segmented LC polyimides prepared from 3,30,4,40-tetracarboxybiphenyl dianhydride (BPDA) and R,ω- bis(4-aminophenoxy)oxyethylene units.11 These polyimides showed liquid crystallinity and lower phase transition tempera- tures compared to the polyimides based on BPDA and diamines with methylene spacer units (>350 C). For practical applica- tions, a further decrease in fabrication temperatures is required to\n\n*Corresponding author.

It is well-known that a siloxane unit is highly flexible, thus polyimides containing siloxane linkages are expected to show lower LC transition temperatures.\n\nIn a preceding work, we briefly reported the synthesis of LC polyimides with flexible siloxane spacer units (Scheme 1).12 These polyimides exhibited high thermal stability and lower LC temperatures compared to the corresponding polyimides con- taining alkylene or ethylene spacer units.\n\nIn this report, we describe the extensive synthesis of novel LC polyimides derived from pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) or BPDA with diamines containing siloxane spacer units and their thermotropic LC behavior in detail. We have demonstrated two approaches for decreasing the crystal-LC transition tempera- tures of LC polyimides. One is the further extension of the length of the siloxane units and/or alkyl chains. The other involves twisting the imide planes of mesogenic units by the ortho- substituted methyl group, leading to a weakening of the inter- molecular interaction of the imide planes. The relationship between molecular designs and LC behavior is discussed in detail.\n\n\\begin{title}\nResults and Discussion\n\\end{title}\n\nSynthesis of Diamines and Polyimides. The diamine mono- mers containing siloxane linkages (3a-3e) were synthesized under the standard conditions for Williamson’s ether syn- thesis, hydrosilylation, and reduction, as shown in Scheme 2. The reaction of 4-nitrophenol or 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol with 4-bromo-1-butene or 6-bromo-1-hexene yielded 1a- 1c in the presence of potassium carbonate in acetonitrile. The hydrosilylation of compound 1a, 1b, or 1c with 1,1,3,3- tetramethyldisiloxane, 1,1,3,3,5,5-hexamethyltrisiloxane, or 1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7-octamethyltetrasiloxane in the presence of Karstedt’s catalyst gave compound 2. Analytically pure compounds were obtained in good yields (65-97%) after purification, which were hydrogenated to prepare monomer diamines 3.\n\n\\begin{title}\n806 Macromolecules, Vol. 43, No. 2, 2010\n\\end{title}\n\nFigure 1 shows the 1H and 13C NMR spectra for diamine 3b in CDCl3. The signal positions in the 1H NMR spec- trum of 3b are consistent with the proposed structures. The signals at 6.74 and 6.63 ppm can be assigned to the aromatic protons. Furthermore, the methyl protons adjacent to the silyl methyl groups appeared at 0.07 and 0.02 ppm. Similarly, the 13C NMR spectrum shows the expected ten signals.\n\nThe LC polyimides 6 showing in Scheme 3 were prepared by using a two-step polycondensation procedure. PMDA (4a) or BPDA (4b) reacted with each diamine 3 at room temperature in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) to produce poly(amic acid)s (PAAs) 5 with high inherent viscosities in the range of 0.65-1.73 dL/g (Table 1). Then, polyimide films were obtained by thermal imidization of the PAAs cast on glass substrates under nitrogen, followed by immersion in warm water. In the representative FT-IR spectrum of pre- pared polyimide 6h, the peaks for the amic acid groups disappeared and the characteristic imide peaks at 1770 (CdO asymmetric stretching), 1712 (CdO symmetric stretching), and 1389 cm-1 (C-N stretching) appeared, indicating complete imidization. In addition, strong absorp- tion bands were also observed at 2958 and 1257 cm-1, corresponding to C-H stretching of the alkyl groups and Si-C stretching of the siloxane groups, respectively, which further confirms the structures of the polyimides.\n\nThermal Properties. Analyses by TGA under nitrogen indicate that all polyimides 6 are thermally stable up to 400 C (Table 1). The DSC curves of all polyimides 6b-6j are shown in Figure 2. Except for polyimides 6d, 6e, and 6j,\n\n\\begin{caption}\nScheme 1.

Birefringence and fluidity were observed in the temperature range between these peaks by cross-polarizing microscopy. Therefore, the phase between the transition temperatures corresponds to a liquid crystalline phase. Compared with polyimides 6c and 6h, polyimide 6c has higher crystalline-LC transition temperatures than poly- imide 6h because the aromatic and imide rings in the mesogenic units of polyimide 6c are coplanar to one another, therefore the intermolecular interactions are stronger be- tween each mesogenic unit than those of polyimide 6h. As a result, polyimides 6a-c and 6f-h show lower crystalline-LC transition temperatures, 257 (6b), 214 (6c), 236 (6f), 236 (6g), and 203 C (6h) on the second cooling by increasing the siloxane units because of the increasing flexibility of the main chains (Table 2, Figure 3). Moreover, we investigated poly- imides 6d and 6i with longer methylene spacer units, which are expected to decrease the transition temperatures. How- ever, there is no noticeable change in the temperatures observed by DSC, which suggests that the methylene units are less flexible than siloxane due to the gauche or trans conformational limitations and are therefore ineffective in decreasing the crystal-LC transition temperature. Interest- ingly, in the case of polyimides 6b-d, the temperature range of LC behavior narrows as the spacer units become longer and, finally, polyimide 6d, which has the longest spacer unit among 6b-d, does not exhibit liquid crystallinity at all. On the other hand, polyimides 6e and 6j, with a methyl- substituted group in the mesogenic units, have also been designed to decrease transition temperatures. We expected that the twisted plane in the mesogenic units by the bulkiness of the methyl-substituted group weakened the intermolecu- lar interaction, which led to a decrease in their transition temperatures. However, neither polyimide 6e or 6j show liquid crystallinity, but instead polyimides 6e and 6j exhibit a crystaline and an amorphous nature, respectively, by DSC trace and polarized optical microscopy (POM).\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nC[Si](C)(CCCCOc1ccc(N)cc1)O[Si](C)(C)O[Si](C)(C)CCCCOc1ccc(N)cc1\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nC[Si](C)(CCCCOc1ccc(N)cc1)O[Si](C)(C)O[Si](C)(C)CCCCOc1ccc(N)cc1\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{legend}\n(B)\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 1.

In order to identify the smectic structure, wide-angle X-ray diffrac- tion (WAXD) measurements were performed for fibers spun from the isotropic melt. The typical X-ray patterns are shown in Figure 5, as observed for 6g, which forms two LC phases. For the higher-temperature LC phase, sharp inner reflections are observed on the equator, i.e., along the fiber axis, and broad outer reflections are observed on the mer- idian (see Figure 5a). These profiles clearly show the forma- tion of the SmA phase.14 On cooling to a lower-temperature LC phase, the inner reflections are evidently split while the outer broad pattern is not significantly altered (Figure 5b), showing the transformation from the SmA to the SmC phase. The tilt angle of the molecules of the layer are elucidated as 22 from the splitting angle, which roughly\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nCc1ccc(-c2ccc(C)c(C)c2)cc1C\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTable 1.

Polyimide 6h also shows a similar SmA-SmC transformation, while 6b, 6c, 6f, and 6j form a single SmA phase before crystallization.\n\nThe present polyimides consist of three components, the aromatic, methylene and siloxane groups so the SmA struc- ture can be illustrated as a microsegregation structure of three components (Figure 6). Referring to this structure, we compared the SmA layer spacings between homologous polyimides. Of interest is that the layer spacing of the SmA phase, i.e., the average length of the repeating unit, does not change significantly as the number of the siloxane units in the homologous series increases. For example, the layer spacings of SmA for 6f, 6g, and 6h are 36.2, 36.1, and 35.9 A˚ , respectively, showing no expansion of layer spacing with an increase of two siloxane units (Table 2).15 From a comparison of 6h and 6i, however, the SmA layer spacing increases from 35.9 to 39.1 A˚ ; an increase of four methylene units causes a 3.2 A˚ increase in layer spacing. Thus, it can be concluded that the alkylene parts in the flexible spacer take a relatively extended shape, conforming similarly to the orien- tational order of the LC, as in the usual case of main-chain LC polymers,14 while the siloxane parts are not extended at all. In other words, the cross sectional area of the siloxane\n\nmicrodomain should be increased to a significant extent, which spontaneously leads to the unusually large cross sectional areas of the alkylene and mesogenic microdomains. In fact, this trend can be found to express on the spacing of the broad reflection that corresponds to the averaged lateral distance of polymers. In Figure 7, 2θ intensity profiles on the equator obtained in the SmA phases of 6f, 6g, 6h, and 6i are shown. From these intensity profiles, one can find that the peak position of the outer broad reflections gradually shifts from 5.5 to 6.4 A˚ with an increase in siloxane units.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 2.

Such an appearance of two outer broad reflections has been observed in similar main-chain polymers including the siloxane spacer,15 and suggests the biaxiality of SmA.17 Thus, the present polymers including the siloxane unit show some abnormality in their smectic structure formation, which will be analyzed in a future study.\n\nIn the course of this study, it was found that all transition temperatures of polyimides 6 became much lower simply by increasing the siloxane units. LC polymers with shorter flexible spacer units are desirable to achieve high thermal conductivity for IC applications. Therefore, the siloxane units indicated the superiority of the alkylene chains for decreasing the transition temperatures and the obtained polyimides are candidates as high thermal conductive polymers.\n\n\\begin{title}\nConclusions\n\\end{title}\n\nWe have synthesized a new series of LC semialiphatic poly- imides containing siloxane spacer units. They showed higher thermal stabilities (Td5%>∼450 C) and lower crystal-LC transition temperatures, 275 (6b), 237 (6c), 253 (6f), 250 (6g), and 222 C (6h), compared to polyimides containing alkylene or oxyethylene spacer units. The transition temperature decreased by the increasing siloxane spacer units, as expected. On the other hand, the methyl-substituted polyimides aiming at twisting the coplanar imide rings and loosening the packing of the mesogens did not show liquid crystallinity, unfortunately. WAXD experi- ments confirmed the layered morphologies of LCpolyimides with siloxane spacer units and their d-spacings. A smectic-A phase was formed in the polyimides derived from PMDA, while the poly- imides based on BPDA formed a smectic-C phase as well as a smectic-A phase. Moreover, the layer spacings of SmA indicated that the alkylene chains in the flexible spacer take a relatively extended conformation, while the siloxane units are not extended at all. From 2θ intensity profiles, the peak position of the outer broad reflections gradually shifts from 5.5 to 6.4 A˚ with an increase of siloxane units. Further, there is the possibility that the biaxiality in the polyimides is derived from PMDA. A detailed investigation of this interesting abnormality is in progress. We also expect that these polyimides will exhibit relatively high thermal conductivity combining with a small amount of thermal conducting fillers and may possibly be used as insulators in electronics fields.\n\n\\begin{title}\nExperimental Section\n\\end{title}\n\nMeasurements. FT-IR spectra were measured on a Horiba FT-720 spectrometer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker DPX300S spectrometer. Inherent viscosities were measured at 30 C in NMP at a polymer concentration of 0.5 g/ dL. The transition characteristics were surveyed with a polariz- ing microscope (OLYMPUS BX51), together with the use of a LINKAM LTS-350 hot-stage equipped with a temperature controller by setting a polyimide film between crossed polarizers. Thermal analysis was performed on a Seiko EX- STAR 6000 TG/DTA 6300 thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 C/min for thermogravimetry (TG) and a Perkin- Elmer DSC7 calorimeter connected to a cooling system at a heating rate of 10 C/min for differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). WAXD measurements were performed at ambient temperature by using a Rigaku-Denki RINT-2500 X-ray gen- erator with monochromic Cu KR radiation (40 kV, 50 mA) from graphite crystal of monochromator and flat-plate type of ima- ging plate.\n\nMaterials. PMDA and BPDA were purified by sublimation prior to use. NMP, acetonitrile and toluene were purified by distillation. Other reagents and solvents were obtained commer- cially and used as received.\n\n\\begin{title}\n810 Macromolecules, Vol. 43, No. 2, 2010\n\\end{title}\n\nGeneral Synthesis for Diamines. The diamine monomers containing siloxane linkages (3a-3e) were synthesized under the standard conditions for Williamson’s ether synthesis, hydro- silylation, and reduction. As a typical experiment, the synthesis of diamine 3a was described as follows. Detailed synthesis and characterization of other diamines (3b-3e) are described in Supporting Information.\n\nSynthesis of 4-(3-Butenyloxy)nitrobenzene (1a).

At low temperature drying stage, the weight and thickness reductions occurred rapidly as a result of solvent evaporation. All the parameters started leveling oﬀwhile the out of plane birefringence steadily increased and reached a plateau at longer drying times. When the temperature was increased for imidization reaction, additional weight loss accom- panied by temporary reduction of birefringence was observed due to\n\nevaporation of bound solvent as solvent molecules decomplexed from the polymer chains and plasticized the ﬁlm. During the latter stage, out-of-plane birefringence rose rapidly due to increased intrinsic birefringence of the polymer chains due to imidization reaction and orientation of polymer chains with their chain axes preferentially oriented in the ﬁlm plane. Throughout the whole process the in-plane birefringence remained zero. For the ﬁrst time, these real time measurements allowed us to quantitatively show the dynamics between chain relaxation due to evaporation of the decomplexed solvent molecules, and orientation development due to decreased chain mobility caused by imidization reaction and increasing Tg for the PMDA− ODA/NMP solutions. In addition, the dynamics of this interplay was investigated by varying the processing conditions: initial casting thickness and drying temperature.\n\n\\begin{title}\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\\end{title}\n\nPolyimide ﬁlms exhibit good thermal stability, high mechanical strength and chemical resistance. These properties allow their use in harsh industrial applications including automotive, aerospace and electronics.1−6 Common polyimides are not soluble in solvents and they degrade when heated due to their high Tg. Because of these restrictions, a two step process was developed to produce high quality polyimide ﬁlms.7−11 First, a precursor polyamic acid (PAA) is synthesized that is soluble in polar, high boiling point solvents such as NMP (N-methyl-2- pyrrolidone), DMAc (dimethylacetamide), and DMF (dime- thylformamide).12 In the second step, PAA is converted to polyimide through thermal imidization.10,13,14 This part of the process can be divided into three sections; (i) solution casting of polyamic acid precursor on to a substrate via blade coating or slot die casting, (ii) drying of precursor to form partially dried ﬁlm, and (iii) thermal treatment to form polyimide ﬁlm.15−17 The critical temperatures for the thermal imidization are 120 °C where imidization reaction starts and 150 °C where the rate of conversion is the fastest.18 As the temperature reaches 200 °C, 90% of conversion is achieved. 100% conversion is reached at higher temperatures, typically 300−450 °C range depending on the chemical structure.13\n\nDuring the multistep imidization process, solvent evapo- ration, polymer chain orientation, chemical conversion, and water loss due to the chemical reaction all take place concurrently.19−21 Because of these changes, ﬁlms experience weight loss, thickness reduction, temperature change, change in rate of diﬀusion for solvent molecules and change in chain\n\nmobility leading to birefringence development (Figure 1). It is very diﬃcult to predict the eﬀect of each processing step on the ﬁnal properties due to the simultaneously changing physical and chemical parameters that are interrelated. The majority of characterization for the polyimide ﬁlms has been performed on the samples that were already imidized after all these events have taken place.22−29 These oﬄine characterization measure- ments provided valuable information on ﬁnal properties that develop as a result of complex events. However, little is known about these sequences of structural/mechanistic details that occur during the course of imidization process.\n\nFor high quality thin polyimide ﬁlm production, a stepwise increase in temperature is preferred. The cast solution is ﬁrst dried at temperatures below 120 °C to form PAA ﬁlm followed by imidization reaction at higher temperatures. It was found that, PAA ﬁlms that are dried at low temperatures contain 30%−50% bound solvent.30,31 Model compound studies for these PAA-solvent systems have revealed that the PAA molecules form complexes with the polar solvent molecules via hydrogen bonding.18,30−35 There are four potential sites that can participate in hydrogen bonding on the backbone of the PAA chains, consisting of two carboxylic acid groups and two amide groups. The binding energies for these groups are diﬀerent, which creates the formation of two distinct solvent complexes with diﬀerent thermal stabilities. It was reported the\n\nReceived: July 1, 2013\n\nRevised: October 10, 2013\n\n\\begin{molecule}\n*n1c(=O)c2cc3c(=O)n(-c4ccc(Oc5ccc(*)cc5)cc4)c(=O)c3cc2c1=O\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 1.

The solvent molecules bonded to amide groups are released earlier due to lower bonding energy compared to that of carboxylic acid group which is a better proton donor.32,33 The release of the solvent molecules has several eﬀects. First, it plasticizes the ﬁlm, causing PAA chains to relax. Second, due to release of the solvent molecules, the active carboxylic acid and amide groups become free for imidization reaction to occur. Hence, decomplexation of these solvent molecules is the driving factor for the imidization reaction. The Tg of this highly viscous medium is much lower compared to that of a fully imidized ﬁlm, and during the reaction, it changes with increasing degree of imidization and loss of solvent.37 Increase in Tg and formation of rigid imide groups decrease the chain mobility that causes the development of spontaneous molecular orientation parallel to the ﬁlm surface during the process.38−45 This orientation development has signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the ﬁnal properties of ﬁlms such as modulus, mechanical anisotropy, thermal expansion coeﬃcient, and optical anisotropy as reﬂected in out-of-plane birefringence.46−50 The imidization conditions, such as imidization temperature, heating rate, and\n\ntime, also play an important role in the development of morphology and ﬁnal properties of these ﬁlms.51−55\n\nAnalysis of such a complex process and evaluation of ﬁnal physical and chemical properties by oﬀ-line characterization techniques can be misleading as the later processes may hinder the details of the early steps. A comprehensive study of this multistep interrelated processes (formation of PAA−solvent complexes, decomplexation of the hydrogen-bonded solvent molecules and subsequent imidization reaction) is required for a complete understanding of the eﬀects of processing conditions on the evolution of structural and mechanical anisotropy in polyimide ﬁlms.\n\nIn this paper, we report a comprehensive study that investigates the real time dynamics of the imidization reaction, covering all the stages of this complex process from solution casting of polyamic acid to polyimide ﬁlm formation. During this study a wind tunnel shaped highly instrumented drying station was used. This instrument is equipped with sensors to track real-time weight, thickness, surface temperature, and in- plane and out-of-plane birefringence during solution drying of polymer ﬁlms.56 The polyamic acid conversion to polyimide was studied with all the physical changes monitored during the process and the eﬀect of processing parameters on the structural development was investigated by varying the initial casting thickness and drying temperature for the ﬁrst time.\n\n\\begin{title}\n2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\n\\end{title}\n\ni. Materials. Polyamic acid solution (PMDA−ODA, 15 wt % solids in NMP) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The solution was cast on glass substrates using a motorized drawdown\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 2. Wind tunnel shaped drying system.\n\\end{caption}\n\ncoater equipped with a commercial 3-in. wide casting blade. The cast solutions were 7 in. in length and 3 in. in width.\n\nii. Measurement System. The details of the measurement system (Figure 2) used in this experiment was reported elsewhere.56 In summary, it is a combination of a hot air blower, wind tunnel shaped frame and sensors for tracking physical changes. Hot air blower can operate at temperatures up to 500 °C and air speeds up to 4.5 m/s at the sample location. The direction of the air ﬂow is shown by the red dashed lines. The blower is connected to the wind tunnel shaped drying tunnel. This shape provides a uniform air ﬂow at the center of the tunnel where the drying sample and sensors are located.\n\nDrying sample and the sensor locations are shown in Figure 3. Polymer solution is cast on a glass substrate and placed on a sample platform that directly sits on a balance to measure the real-time weight\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 3. Drying sample, sensors, and measurement locations.\n\\end{caption}\n\nof the drying solution. The sample thickness is measured by a combination of three laser displacement sensors. These lasers measure the displacement of the glass substrate top surface and the drying sample top surface at two locations (upstream of the air ﬂow and mid section of the solution). By subtracting the two values, the thickness of the drying solution is calculated at two locations. Surface temperature of the drying solution is measured by four pyrometers that are located very close to the center of the drying solution.\n\nReal-time birefringence is measured by spectral birefringence method.57−75 The in-plane and out-of-plane birefringence is calculated by measuring the 0° and 45° retardation values. The optical light paths for these measurements are shown with yellow transparent tubes in the ﬁgure below.\n\nFor the in-plane and out-of-plane birefringence (Δn12and Δn23)- calculations Stein’s equations are used (eqs 1 and 2)76\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta n_{1 2}=\\frac{R_{0} ( t )} {d ( t )}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{token}\n(1)\n\\end{token}\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta n_{2 3}=-\\frac{1} {d ( t )} \\Biggl[ \\frac{R_{0} ( t ) \\,-\\, R_{\\phi} ( t ) \\sqrt{1 \\,-\\, \\frac{\\sin^{2} \\phi} {\\pi^{2}}}} {\\frac{\\sin^{2} \\phi} {\\pi^{2}}} \\Biggr]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{token}\n(2)\n\\end{token}\n\nwhere R0(t) is instantaneous 0° retardation, d(t) is the instantaneous thickness, RΦ(t) is retardation value at angle Φ (45° in this case), and n̅ is the average refractive index of the drying solution. The average refractive index was estimated from the weight change assuming no volume change during mixing. The real-time average refractive index was calculated using eq 3 below, where φ is the weight fraction. Refractive index of solvent was measured as 1.47 and the refractive index of polyimide was estimated 1.693 respectively by Abbé refractometer at 633 nm.39 The initial concentration of the solution was 15 wt % solid and refractive index of the solutions was 1.507. The refractive index of pure polyamic acid form of PMDA−ODA ﬁlm could not be measured, as this material always forms complexes with the solvent molecules. If the temperature was increased to evaporate the solvent, the imidization reaction started and the material was no longer purely polyamic acid. Hence for this study, the refractive indices of polyamic acid and polyimide of PMDA−ODA were accepted as 1.72 at 633 nm.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\overline{{{n}}} \\,=\\, \\overline{{{n}}}_{s o l v e n t} \\phi_{s o l v e n t} \\,+\\, \\overline{{{n}}}_{s o l i d} \\varphi_{s o l i d}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{token}\n(3)\n\\end{token}\n\nWe recently showed the development of anisotropy through the thickness direction of solution cast polymer ﬁlms experimentally by measuring the birefringence through thickness and refractive index values at both the air−solution interface and substrate−solution interface directly. Highly oriented skin layers on both air and substrate interface developed for poly(amide−imide)/DMAc solutions com- pared to the core during drying. It was observed that the use of average\n\nrefractive index value for the out-of-plane birefringence calculations caused only a 5% deviation from the actual birefringence values that were calculated directly from the developed gradient during drying.77\n\niii. Experimental Parameters. A typical industrial roll to roll polyimide ﬁlm processing stages are illustrated in Figure 1.78−82 After the blade coating or slot die casting of the solution, it enters into drying zone. In this zone, the material is dried to remove the excess amount of high boiling point solvent. The temperature is kept below 120 °C where no imidization reaction takes place.\n\nWhen the ﬁlm is suﬃciently dried, it is separated from the carrier and passes through a transition zone. In this zone, the temperature starts to rise to imidization temperature, in the range 120−450 °C depending on the chemical structure and desired imidization degree. In this zone, the sample is constrained for dimensional stability to prevent shrinkage due to solvent loss and imidization reaction. After this stage it travels deeper into the imidization zone where the temperature is kept constant at higher values for imidization to complete and remove all the remaining bound solvent.\n\nOur real time measurement system is capable of applying all the conditions listed and measure the physical parameters changing during each stage of the industrial processing step. These measurements include real time weight, thickness, surface temperature, and in-plane and out-of-plane birefringence.\n\n\\begin{title}\n3. RESULTS\n\\end{title}\n\nTo experimentally simulate the actual imidization process, PAA/NMP solution was cast on glass substrate at room temperature, placed on top of the sample platform inside the preheated chamber and data acquisition was started. The sample was ﬁrst dried for 4 h at low temperatures and then the temperature was increased to the imidization temperature, 200 °C for the next 4 h. The air speed was kept constant at 0.5 m/s during the experiment.\n\ni. Imidization Veriﬁcation. To verify the chemical conversion, imidization of the PMDA−ODA samples were measured at diﬀerent temperatures for 5 μm thick ﬁlms. The solution cast polyamic acid ﬁlms were kept in a vacuum oven at diﬀerent temperatures for 60 min. The IR spectra of these samples were compared with the fully imidized ﬁlm that was kept at 180 °C for 45 min and 350 °C for 60 min. Figure 4 shows the results calculated by eq 4, using the imide peak area (CN stretching) at 1380 cm−1, normalized with the aromatic ring stretching peak area at 1500 cm−1. This peak is not aﬀected from the chemical change. This ratio was normalized with the ratio of the fully imidized ﬁlm.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 4.

Overview of the Process. As Figure 5 shows, the ﬁrst 4 h of the experiment corresponds to solution casting and drying of the PAA solution (i), where the temperature was kept low to prevent imidization. In ensuing stage, the temperature was raised to 200 °C and we continued to track the physical parameters during this transition (II) into imidization (III) stages as the temperature was increased. During the drying stage (i), the weight and thickness values decreased rapidly due to solvent evaporation (Figure 6). This caused simultaneous solidiﬁcation and shrinkage mainly in the thickness direction as the ﬁlm is constrained in the x−y plane as it is adhered to the substrate. As the drying proceeds, the in-plane birefringence remains zero, indicating the preservation of in-plane isotropy. Beyond a critical drying stage, the out of plane birefringence starts to increase. This is aﬀected by the a competition between the relaxation and reorientation of the polymer chains in the plane as the ﬁlm is undergoing compression during drying.84−92 This competition is apparent in Figure 6. Initial sections of the drying were solvent rich, which indicates the relaxation times are shorter and both the in-plane and out-of-plane birefringence values remained very close to zero. As the drying proceeded (t ∼2000 s) the rate of weight and thickness loss started to level oﬀwhile the onset of out-of-plane birefringence development was observed. At this point the sample can support stresses and the relaxation times increase. After 4 h, the evaporation of solvent substantially decreases. At this stage the partially dried sample contains about 30−40% solvent by weight.\n\nThe details of the transition zone, where the temperature is increased from 100 to 200 °C, is shown in Figure 7. As the temperature gradually increases, additional weight loss and thickness reduction is observed associated with the evaporation of the bound solvent. We also observe the temporary decrease of out of plane birefringence before beginning to increase again beyond 15000 s. This decrease is attributed to the plasticization eﬀect of the decomplexed bound solvent, leading to relaxation. However, at a critical temperature value (∼150−160 °C), the rate of the imidization reaction increases suﬃciently enough that decreases the chain mobility, as a result of the formation of rigid polyimide chains as well as increased Tg due to evaporation of bound solvent. At this point, out-of-plane birefringence increases at a higher rate as compared to the previous drying section that indicates the increase in the out-of- plane birefringence is a combination of two reasons. The ﬁrst reason is the conversion of polyamic acid chains into more rigid polyimide chains with higher intrinsic birefringence. The second reason is the increasing chain orientation with chain axes parallel to the surface . The stress eﬀect has minor role in this birefringence development. Weight loss indicates the continuation of the evaporation of the bound solvent and the evaporation of the water that is formed during the reaction. Transition zone clearly shows that the orientation development is a balance between the solvent evaporation induced relaxation and the continual orientation of polyimide chains parallel to the ﬁlm surface as the chain mobility decreases due to imidization reaction and consequent increase in Tg.37,51−54,93\n\n\\begin{legend}\n回\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nⅢ  \n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 5.

Regime i drying zone.\n\\end{caption}\n\nThe ﬁnal stage is shown in Figure 8. The weight, thickness and out-of-plane birefringence values start to level oﬀas the evaporation of all the bound solvent. The leveling oﬀof the out-of-plane birefringence also indicates the imidization reaction slows down signiﬁcantly. The formation of high Tg polyimide molecules and the evaporation of almost all solvent and water molecule formed during the reaction rapidly decreases the chain mobility.\n\niii. Inﬂuence of Thickness. To ascertain its inﬂuence on drying behavior, we prepared ﬁlms with 500, 250, and 100 μm casting thickness. In the ﬁrst step the temperature was kept at 100 °C at 0.5 m/s air speed and the ﬁlms were dried for 4 h. In the next 4 h, the temperature was increased to 200 °C to for the imidization reaction. At this temperature approximately 90% of the imidization has been achieved. Real-time data for weight, thickness, surface temperature and in-plane and out-of-plane birefringence values were measured during the process.\n\nAs expected (Figure 9, parts a and b) as the casting thickness decreases, weight loss occurs faster due to higher evaporation rate of the solvent as shorter path lengths the solvent molecules has to travel to reach the surface and evaporate. Figure 9c shows the section of the process where the temperature started to increase to imidization temperature of 200 °C. The temperature increase causes decomplexation of the bound solvent leading to additional weight loss mentioned earlier. The % weight losses for 500, 250, and 100 μm thick cast solutions are 21%, 26%, and 37%, respectively, between 13000 and 17000 s.\n\nThickness change during the initial stages of the process for diﬀerent initial casting thicknesses are shown in Figure 10. Similar to weight loss, the rate of thickness loss is faster as the initial casting thickness decreases. When the temperature was increased to 200 °C for imidization reaction to take place, no clear change in the thickness values was observed for all\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 7. Regime ii heating zone.\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 8. Regime iii imidization zone.\n\\end{caption}\n\nthicknesses (inset graph in Figure 10). However, since the weight loss (Figure 9) indicates the evaporation of solvent, the thickness values should decrease. Laser displacement sensors failed to detect the thickness change during the temperature increase, which is mainly due to the sensor sensitivity. The ﬁnal thickness values for 500, 250, and 100 μm thick cast solutions were measured as 36, 21, and 10 μm respectively via oﬀ-line thickness gage after the process.\n\nOverall in-plane and out-of-plane birefringence development for all three thicknesses are shown in Figure 11a. During the process, the in-plane birefringence remained zero and out-of- plane birefringence increased with the decreasing initial casting thickness.\n\nInitial 5000 s of the process is shown in Figure 11b where the cast solutions were dried at 100 °C. This temperature is below the temperature range where little or no imidization occurs during drying. The development of the out-of-plane birefrin- gence is attributed mainly due to the shrinkage of the ﬁlm in the thickness direction since it is constrained in the x−y plane\n\nof the glass substrate. The increase of birefringence values with decreasing thickness is attributed to the rapid reduction of relaxation rates with reduced initial thickness leading to increased overall orientation as the evaporation rate of the solvent decreases. (Figure 9 and Figure 10).\n\nFigure 11c shows the period where the set temperature is increased to 200 °C for imidization reaction to occur. The orientation in this section starts to decrease initially because of the plasticization eﬀect of the decomplexed solvent molecules as temperature increases. However as the temperature continues to increase, the rate of imidization reaction increases that causes increase in the intrinsic birefringence and orientation of polymer chains parallel to the surface. This scheme is similar for all three thicknesses, with a slight delay in the 100 μm ﬁlm. The reason for this delay might be the low content of the bound solvent in this sample. As mentioned earlier, the decomplexation process of the solvent assists in the imidization reaction in two ways, making the chains mobile and releasing the active groups that participate in the rigidifying\n\n\\begin{legend}\na\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nb\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 9. Eﬀect of thickness on weight change during the process.\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 10. Eﬀect of thickness on % thickness change during imidization.\n\\end{caption}\n\nimidization reaction. Since the 100 μm ﬁlm possesses the lowest amount of solvent, the chain mobility is slightly lower in this system which might be the reason for the shift. The changes in the behavior for 500 and 250 μm samples occur nearly at the same time.\n\nSimilar to the drying behavior, the ﬁnal birefringence value increases with decreasing thickness. All these observations are in good agreement with the literature.84−92\n\niv. Inﬂuence of Drying Temperature. It is possible to control the processing mechanisms and ﬁne-tune the ﬁnal properties of polyimide ﬁlms by changing the drying temper- ature. The inﬂuence of drying temperature was investigated by using ﬁve diﬀerent temperatures, 100, 120, 140, 160, and 200 °C for 4 h, followed by temperature increase to 200 °C for the next 4 h. Real-time data for weight, thickness, surface temperature, and in-plane and out-of-plane birefringence values were measured during the process. The experiment conditions are summarized at the Table 1.\n\n\\begin{legend}\nTime (s)\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nc\n\\end{legend}\n\nWeight change (%) during the overall process for diﬀerent drying temperatures is shown in Figure 12. Figure 12-b focuses on the ﬁrst 2000 s of the process where majority of the solvent evaporation took place. As expected, increasing the temperature leads to higher rate of weight loss. Also higher temperatures result in lower weight that indicates more solvent is removed from the medium at this stage. Figure 12-c focuses on the temperature increase region after 4 h of drying. All the samples that had diﬀerent drying temperature were increased to 200 °C to ﬁnalize the imidization reaction. The weight loss on the 100 and 120 °C is apparent and the 140 °C, 160 °C, 200 °C samples does not exhibit this decrease which indicates the solvent evaporation took place at earlier stages at higher temperatures. The percent weight changes also indicated that the higher temperature drying results in the lower solvent content remaining in the ﬁlms.\n\nThickness change during the initial stages of the process for diﬀerent drying temperatures is shown in Figure 13. Similar to weight loss, the rate of thickness decrease is higher for the higher drying temperatures. Similar to previous observations, when the temperature was increased to 200 °C for imidization reaction to take place, no change in the thickness values was observed for diﬀerent temperatures (inset graph in Figure 13). Since the weight loss (Figure 12) indicates the evaporation of solvent for the lowest two drying temperatures100 and 120 °C, the thickness values for these temperatures should also decrease slightly. Again, laser displacement sensors failed to detect the thickness change during this stage. The ﬁnal thickness values for 100 °C, 120 °C, 140 °C, 160 and 200 °C were measured as 36 μm, 37 μm, 34 μm, 33 and 28 μm respectively via oﬀ-line thickness gage.\n\nIn-plane and out-of-plane birefringence developments for all drying temperatures are shown in Figure 14-a. Overall; the in- plane birefringence remained nearly zero for all samples and out-of-plane birefringence increased with the increasing drying temperature throughout the process.\n\n\\begin{legend}\nb\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 11.

The 100 °C sample is below the imidization temperature and 120 °C is the onset temperature for imidization reaction. The imidization reaction is fastest at150 °C, so 140 and 160 °C were selected because they were just above and below of this value. Continuous 200 °C was applied during the last experiment. The evaporation of solvent and simultaneous imidization\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 13.

The development of the out-of-plane birefringence during this experiment had several reasons. The ﬁrst one was the evaporation of the solvent, the second is the increasing intrinsic birefringence of the medium and the last one is the liquid crystalline like order for the rigid and semiﬂexible polymers in the concentrated solutions and solid ﬁlms. This increase is induced by the orientation of the polymer chains parallel to the ﬁlm surface as mentioned earlier.84−92 The ﬁnal reason is the simultaneous imidization reaction for the temperatures higher than 120 °C. Both of these processes decreased the mobility of the polymer chains and the relaxation times were much higher as the drying temperature was increased and orientation behavior dominated.\n\nFigure 14-c shows the region where the set temperature was increased to 200 °C for imidization reaction to occur. For the 100 and 120 °C drying temperatures, the out-of-plane birefringence value initially decreased because of the plasti-\n\n\\begin{legend}\n0.10\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\na\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nTime (s)\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nb\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 14.

However as the temperature continued to increase, the rate of imidization increased and dominated the orientation develop- ment. The samples dried at 140 and 160 °C showed very small relaxations, indicating the evaporation of the majority of the solvent molecules took place earlier in the process and the evaporation of the remaining solvent was not enough to enhance enough chain mobility to decrease the orientation levels substantially, as seen on the lower drying temperatures (100 and 120 °C).\n\nSimilar to the drying behavior, the ﬁnal birefringence value increased with increasing drying temperature. All these observations are in very good agreement with the litera- ture.84−92\n\n\\begin{title}\n4. DISCUSSION\n\\end{title}\n\nThe details of imidization process are summarized in Figure 15. At point a on the graph (t = 0 s) the dilute PAA solution includes both free and H-bonded solvent molecules. Between points a and b, rapid weight loss indicates the evaporation of the nonbonded free solvent molecules from the medium. At point b, the rate of weight loss becomes very small and evaporation decreases substantially. During this stage a drying front that separates the liquid region from the glassy region starts to enter into the birefringence measurement area in the direction of air ﬂow. As more solvent evaporates, from point b to c, polymer solution solidiﬁes and starts to support the stresses formed during drying. Drying front and the glassy region travels through the ﬁlm and passes from the birefringence measurement area. At this stage the relaxation times are slowed down and as a result out-of-plane birefringence value continues to increase, indicating orientation of the PAA molecules parallel to the ﬁlm surface. At point d, the polyamic acid ﬁlm is formed that has substantial solvent\n\n\\begin{legend}\na\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nb\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 15. Overview of the process.\n\\end{caption}\n\ncontent in it. These solvent molecules form complexes with PAA chains. At this point, the Tg of the system increased to the ambient temperature due to evaporation of the nonbonded solvent and the chain mobility decreases considerably leading to leveling oﬀof out-of-plane birefringence. The same critical phenomenon was observed during drying of transparent soluble polyimides.94 There is very little or no imidization up until this point. When the temperature is increased right after the point d, the bound solvent molecules start to decomplex from the PAA chains and travel through the thickness to the surface of the ﬁlm and evaporate. The decomplexed solvent molecules spend some time in the medium as they travel and this reﬂects as a time lag on the weight loss. Traveling free solvent molecules and increasing temperature plasticize the environ- ment which result a decrease in the out-of-plane birefringence up until point e. At this point, the rate of the imidization reaction increases signiﬁcantly because the evaporation of solvent increases the chain mobility and exposes the reactive ends for the imidization reaction. Carboxylic acid and amide groups become active as the decomplexation continues from the PAA chains. The rapid formation of the rigid polyimide chains and their orientation parallel to the ﬁlm surface started to dominate the relaxation induced by the solvent evaporation and water formation due to the reaction. The rapid increase of out-of-plane birefringence during imidization was attributed to two main events, one is the increasing intrinsic birefringence of the medium due to chemical conversion and the second is the development of oriented layer formation with the preferential alignment of polymer chains in the plane of the ﬁlm.28,40,78 It is clear from the graph that the imidization induced molecular orientation and solvent evaporation occurs simultaneously, because, while birefringence is increasing after point e, the weight continues to decrease slightly. At certain imidization conditions, it is apparent that the drying induced orientation is lost completely when the temperature is increased to imidization temperature. As the experiment reaches point f,\n\n\\begin{caption}\nRemoval of bound solvent with temperature increase causing weight loss and chain relaxation (acting as plasticizer), followed by imidization and orientation\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{legend}\n≤`\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\ne\n\\end{legend}\n\nthe weight loss and birefringence increase level oﬀas the Tg increases and chain mobility diminishes. At point f, most of the solvent evaporated and the conversion to polyimide is about 90%.\n\n\\begin{title}\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\\end{title}\n\nThe dynamic relationship between the relaxation and chain orientation has been observed real-time on the imidization process of PMDA−ODA/NMP solution. At low temperature drying stage (T < 120 °C), orientation occurs due to preferential orientation of polymer chains parallel in the plane of the ﬁlm. At early stages of imidization (120 °C < T < 150 °C) temporary decrease of birefringence due to chain relaxation caused by the evaporation of the decomplexed solvent molecules was observed. At higher temperatures (T > 150 °C) optical anisotropy development dominates due to decreased chain mobility as a result of imidization reaction and increasing Tg.\n\nIt was shown how this competition between the two events was aﬀected independently for each stage (drying, transition, and imidization) in the imidization process by changing the processing parameters. The level of orientation development, weight loss and solvent evaporation was aﬀected by the changing processing conditions such as initial casting thickness and drying temperatures. This study showed that it is possible to ﬁne-tune the ﬁnal orientation level during the drying and imidization stages simply by changing the processing conditions without the necessity of postprocessing techniques.\n\n\\begin{title}\nINFORMATION\n\\end{title}\n\n\\begin{title}\nCorresponding Author\n\\end{title}\n\n*E-mail: (M.C.) cakmak1@uakron.edu.\n\n\\begin{title}\nNotes\n\\end{title}\n\n\\begin{title}\nThe authors declare no competing ﬁnancial interest.\n\\end{title}\n\n\\begin{title}\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\\end{title}\n\nFunding for this study was kindly provided by the State of Ohio Third Frontier program under the grant “Research and Commercialization of Polyimides”.\n\n\\begin{title}\nREFERENCES\n\\end{title}\n\n(1) St. Clair, A.

The polymer was prepared from oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA) and 3,4-oxydianiline (ODA) in diglyme. In order to obtain optimal flow properties, which improves wetting, the molecular weight of the polymer was controlled by use of a monofunctional anhydride, phthalic anhydride (PA).\n\nAdhesively bonded lap shear specimens, using Ti-6AI-4V adherends, were prepared and tested to assess its adhesive potential. Specimens were exposed to water boil and thermal aging to determine the adhesive system's durability. Flatwise tensile strength and critical fracture energy were also deter- mined.

INTRODUCTION\n\\end{title}\n\nBecause of the anticipated needs of the aerospace industry for high temperature polymers for use in various applications, research has continued at Langley Research Center on the synthesis and development of new, inexpensive, flexible, aromatic, high temperature polymers. A recent result of that goal was the develop- ment of the thermoplastic, linear polyimide, LARC-TPI, that exhibited excep- tional adhesive and other properties [1-3]. The polyimide is presently\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nO=C1c2ccc(C(=O)c3ccc4c(c3)C(=O)N(c3cccc(C(=O)c5ccc(C)cc5)c3)C4=O)cc2C(=O)N1C\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nLARC-TPI Tg=260°C(500°F)\n\\end{legend}\n\nproduced by several suppliers in film, molding powder, prepreg, and solution (varnish) forms. However, present concern of the physiological effects due to the\n\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.\n\ndiamine component, 3,3'-diaminobenzophenone (DABP), and its relatively expensive cost tend to detract from its other excellent attributes. Therefore, a new polyimide with properties similar to LARC-TPI has been synthesized and evaluated. The polymer, identified as LARC-IA (Langley Research Center- Improved Adhesive), has been prepared in diglyme as a 15 wt % solids solution from oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA) and 3,4'-oxydianiline (ODA). The mol- ecular weight, and therefore, its flow, was controlled by use of a monofunctional anhydride [phthalic anhydride (PA)]. This polymer is of particular interest as a possible replacement for LARC-TPI, a commercially available polyimide with exceptional adhesive properties as well as being a highly thermooxidatively stable material. LARC-TPI is presently available in several forms: films, molding powder, 30 wt % solids solution (varnish), and prepreg. However, the 3,3'-diaminobenzo- phenone component is expensive and its physiological effects are uncertain. LARC-IA is synthesized from noncarcinogenic, nontoxic chemicals which are relatively inexpensive.\n\nThe adhesive evaluation of this new polyimide, LARC-IA with and without endcaps, is the primary subject of this report. The effects of an aluminum powder filler was also investigated. Flatwise tensile strength (FWT), critical fracture energy and several LARC-IA film properties were determined. Preliminary results were also obtained for composites composed of LARC-IA with 5 wt % PA endcap [LARC-IA (5% PA)] and graphite fiber (AS4, 12K).\n\n\\begin{title}\n2.

The 3,4'-oxydianiline (3,4'-ODA) was supplied by Kennedy and Klim Incorporated, Little Silver, NJ.\n\nThe polymer that was primarily used as the adhesive was prepared in reagent grade bis(2-methoxyethyl)ether (diglyme) at 16.5% solids. The ODPA (60.4935 g) was mixed with 3,4'-ODA (40.0480 g) in 515 g of diglyme at room temperature (RT). This mixture was stirred overnight and PA (1.4812 g) was added and stirring continued for an additional 30 min. This solution was stored for 48 h at 4°C and its inherent viscosity, 1'Jinh, was determined to be 0.47 dl/g (0.5% in DMAc at 35°C). This gave a polymer with a 2.5% molar excess of the diamine which was endcapped with 5.0 mol % monofunctional PA. The un- endcapped version of the polymer was prepared in the same manner with equimolar amounts of the ODPA and 3,4'-ODA (1'Jinh 0.63 dl/g). A 10% end- capped version was prepared in a like manner with a 5% molar excess of diamine and 10 mol % of PA (1'Jinh 0.25 dl/g).\n\n\\begin{title}\n2.2. Characterization\n\\end{title}\n\nLap shear strength (LSS) was determined according to ASTM D1002 using an Instron Universal Testing Machine. The LSSs reported represent an average of four lap shear specimens per test condition except as noted in the tables. The range of LSSs is indicated by dashed lines in the bar graphs and is listed in the tables. Elevated temperature tests were conducted in a clam-shell, quartz-lamp oven with temperatures controlled to ± 3°C for all tests. Specimens were held 10 min at temperature prior to testing except for the water boil tests which were conducted upon reaching the test temperature (approximately 1-2 min).\n\nBondline thickness for the bonded titanium lap shear specimens is defined as the difference between the total joint thickness measured with a micrometer and the sum of the adherend thicknesses. The average bondline thickness for the thermally aged and water boil specimens was 0.023 cm for LARC-IA, 0.010 cm for LARC-IA (5% PA), and 0.017 cm for LARC-IA (5% PA) 50% Al powder.\n\nGlass transition temperatures ( Tg) were determined using a DuPont 990 Thermal Analyzer in conjunction with a DuPont Model 943 Thermal Mechanical Analyzer (TMA)*. TMAs for films were run in static air at a heating rate of 5°C/min with a load of 0.5-2.0 g. Tgs, determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), were obtained on a DuPont 1090 Thermal Analyzer in conjunction with a Model 910 Differential Scanning Calorimeter run at 20°C/min.\n\nInherent viscosity was determined using a Cannon-Ubbelohde viscometer in a 35°C water bath controlled to within ± 0.01°C. A 10 ml solution of 0.5 wt/vol % solids in dimethylacetamide (DMAc) was made and filtered.\n\nThe type of failure in lap shear tests was evaluated visually using a 10 x magnification and estimating the percent area of each type of failure, cohesive or interfacial.\n\nFWT was determined according to ASTM C297 using 5.1 x 5.1 cm specimens tested at RT.\n\n*Use of trade names or manufacturers does not constitute an official endorsement, either expressed or implied, by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nCritical fracture energy was determined using a double cantilever beam specimen in accordance with ref. [4]. The film properties: yield strength, tensile strength, tensile modulus, and elongation were determined according to ASTM D882.\n\nThe mechanical properties, flexural strength and flexural modulus, were obtained for LARC-IA (5% PA)/AS4, 12K composite according to ASTM D790.\n\nThe solvent resistance of LARC-IA film was evaluated by immersing a strip of film, 0.64 cm x 1.27 cm, in several different solvents for 72 h, removing the film and assessing the results visually as well as determining the Tg by TMA and DSC techniques.\n\n\\begin{title}\n2.3. Adhesive tape\n\\end{title}\n\nThe adhesive tapes were prepared by brush coating the polymer solution [ 15 wt % for LARC-IA, 11inh 0.63 dl/g; 16.5 wt % for LARC-IA (5% PA), 11inh 0.47 dl/g; and 16.9 wt % for LARC-IA (10% PA), 11 inh 0.25 dl/g] in diglyme onto a 112 E-glass cloth with an A-1100 finish (y-aminopropyltriethoxysilane) (Union Carbide). The glass cloth had been tightly mounted on a metal frame and dried in a forced-air oven for 30 min at 100°C prior to coating. The 0.10 mm thick glass cloth served as a carrier for the adhesive as well as for bondline thickness control and an escape channel for the solvent. After a primer coat (=7.5 wt % solids solution) was applied and dried, several applications of the orginally prepared solution were used until the thickness of the tape was 0.20-0.30 mm. After each coat was applied, the tape was air-dried at ambient for 0.5-1.0 h, placed in a forced-air oven, and exposed to the following schedule:\n\n(1) RT - 1 00°C, held 1 h;\n\n(2) 1 00°C - 1 50°C, held 1 h; and\n\n(3) 150°C -175°C, held 1 h.\n\nThe procedure used to prepare the tapes was required to drive off the solvent and reaction product volatiles when converting the polyamic acid resin to the polyimide. Imidization of most polyamic acids to polyimides generally occurs in the 160°C range, with the degree of conversion being a function of time and temperature. The prepared tapes were stiff with no tack or drape.\n\nThe same procedure was used to prepare the powdered aluminum filled tapes. The aluminum (Alcan Aluminum Corp., grade MD105, 98% minimum Al content, 4.5-6.4 pm particle size) was added to the polymer solution at 50% by weight of the polymer solids content.\n\n\\begin{title}\n2.4. Adhesive bonding\n\\end{title}\n\nThe prepared adhesive tapes were used to bond lap shear specimens with titanium adherends (Ti-6A1-4V, per Mil-T-9046E, Type III Comp. C) that were a nominal 1.27 mm thick. The four-fingered Ti-6A1-4V panels were grit-blasted with 120 grit aluminum oxide, washed and rinsed with methanol, and surface treated with Pasa-Jell 107* treatment to form a stable oxide on the surface. The adherends were primed with a 7.5 wt % solution of the same resin that was used to prepare the tape. The primer was air-dried 0.5 h, then heated in a forced-air oven for\n\n*Trade name for a titanium surface treatment available from Semco, Glendale, CA.\n\n15 min at 100°C and 15 min at 150°C prior to bonding. Lap shear specimens were prepared by inserting the adhesive tape between the primed adherends using a 12.7 mm overlap. Each adhesive system was bonded using three different bonding conditions. Bonding temperature was monitored using a type K thermocouple spotwelded next to the bond area. Selection of the optimized bond condition was based on that giving the highest LSSs. The selected bonding condition was then used to prepare specimens for the aging and water boil tests.\n\nFWT specimens for LARC-IA (5% PA) and LARC-IA (5% PA) 50% Al were prepared from titanium honeycomb core (= 2.71 mm thick) and Ti-6Al-4V facesheets (==0.51 mm thick). Both the core and facesheets were given a Pasa-Jell 107 surface treatment and primed prior to bonding. Bonding conditions were: 8°C/min heating rate, 0.34 MPa pressure, RT- 371 °C held 1 h. 5.1 x 5.1 cm specimens were cut and bonded to the test blocks with HT-424 adhesive (American Cyanamid Company). Tests were performed at RT.\n\nDouble cantilever beam (DCB) specimens, also bonded with LARC-IA (5% PA) and LARC-IA (5% PA) 50% Al, were prepared using 1.21 mm thick Ti-6AI-4V with a Pasa-Jell surface treatment and primed prior to bonding. The DCB configuration, testing, and calculations are presented in ref. [4]. Bonding conditions were: 8°C/min heating rate, 2.07 MPa pressure, and RT- 371°C held 1 h.\n\n\\begin{title}\n2.5. Thermal and water boil exposure\n\\end{title}\n\nA bonding cycle was selected which was based on the highest LSS and was used to prepare specimens to determine the effects of thermal exposure in a forced-air oven at 204°C ± 2°C for up to 5000 h. Lap shear tests were conducted at RT, 177, 204 and 232°C before (controls) and after exposure.\n\nA 72-h water boil test was conducted in laboratory glassware containing boiling distilled water. Lap shear specimens were immersed above and bonded area during a 72-h period. LSSs were determined at RT, 177, 204 and 232°C.\n\n\\begin{title}\n2.6. LARC-IA film solvent resistance\n\\end{title}\n\nA nominal 0.025 mm thick LARC-IA film was prepared by doctoring a 15 wt % solids solution in diglyme on a glass plate and curing in a forced-air oven for 1 h at each temperature of 100, 200 and 300°C. Films were soaked at RT for a 72-h period in methylene chloride, diglyme, DMAc, m-cresol and N-methyl-2-pyr- rolidone. Films were patted dry with hand wipes and visually evaluated. T9 was then determined by TMA and DSC.\n\n\\begin{title}\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\\end{title}\n\n\\begin{title}\n3.1. Chemistry\n\\end{title}\n\nThe adhesive properties of LARC-TPI have been attributed to the high degree of flexibility in the polymer backbone afforded by the bridged dianhydride and the meta-linked diamine [5]. The 3,3'-BTDA diamine is expensive to synthesize (> $110/kg). Also, because it has been shown to give a positive Ames test, this material must be handled with great care which adds to the cost of the resulting\n\nadhesive. However, once the diamine has been reacted into the polymer backbone it should no longer pose a hazard.\n\nThe novel diamine 3,4'-ODA has been commercially developed in Japan for potential use in high modulus aromatic polyimides. This diamine has been tested and shown to have very low mutagenic activity in the Ames test [6]. Also the monomer, ODPA, has become commercially available. The combination of these two monomers in diglyme affords a polyimide which has exceptional adhesive properties especially when its molecular weight is controlled. Examination of molecular models shows this new polyimide, LARC-IA, to have similar chain flexibility to LARC-TPI.\n\n\\begin{title}\n3.2. Bonding temperature and pressure\n\\end{title}\n\nSelection of the optimum bonding conditions for each polymer was based on obtaining the best compromise of high LSS for tests at RT, 177, 204 and 232°C. Results are expressed in graphical form for those interested in obtaining a quick pictorial summary of the results, and in tabular form for those interested in more detail and additional information not included in the graphs.\n\nIn general, the LSSs decrease with temperature with a drastic decrease as the T9 is approached. Therefore, in most cases, the 232°C strength is greatly reduced from that at 204°C.\n\n3.2.1. LARC-IA. As shown in Fig. 2 and given in Table 1, three combinations of temperature and pressure were evaluated using either 2.07 or 3.45 MPa pressure and 343 or 371°C temperature. Little flashing or squeeze-out was observed for the polymer after bonding, indicating poor flow properties.

A significant increase in LSS was noted for the 204 and 232°C tests (21.1 MPa vs 15.7 and 14.7 MPa for the 204°C tests and 9.1 MPa vs 5.6 and 5.8 MPa for the 232°C tests). Therefore, specimens for thermal aging and water boil were prepared using 2.07 MPa pressure and 371°C temperature conditions.\n\n3.2.2. LARC-IA (5% PA). LSS results for LARC-IA (5% PA) adhesive are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2. The same three bonding conditions used for LARC-IA were again used to evaluate LARC-IA (5% PA). Squeeze-out is evident indicating improved flow due to the control of the molecular weight by end- capping with phthalic anhydride. The best compromise of LSS values is again evident for the 2.07 MPa and 371°C bonding conditions. Excellent LSSs are obtained at RT, 177 and 204°C for all three bonding conditions (RT, 44.0-45.6 MPa; 177°C, 32.5-36.6 MPa; and 204°C, 23.9-28.4 MPa).\n\n3.2.3. LARC-IA (10% PA). Because of the increase in the percent of end- capping, greater flow was expected during bonding and, therefore, in two cases, a lower bonding pressure was used. Test results for LARC-IA ( 10% PA) are shown in Fig. 4 and given in Table 3. Greater squeeze-out is noticed for this polymer which was also more brittle than LARC-IA and LARC-IA (5% PA). However, although the RT LSS is slightly lower for the 0.69 MPa/371°C condition than for the other two conditions evaluated, the 232°C strength increases by = 3 MPa and the 177 and 204°C strengths remained the same. Because the 5% PA endcapped adhesive provided higher strengths than the 10% PA endcapped adhesive, no thermal aging or water boil tests were conducted with the 10% PA endcapped adhesive.\n\n\\begin{title}\nTi-6Al-4V Adherends\n\\end{title}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 3.

The addition of aluminum powder filler to the LARC-IA (5% PA) material was investigated because past experience has shown that improvement in strength and use temperature were realized by this technique [7]. As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 4, excellent LSSs are obtained for all test temperatures and bond conditions. An improvement in strength for the 232°C tests is evident (13.6 MPa vs 9.3 MPa previously obtained). The best results for the LARC-IA (5% PA) 50% Al powder adhesive are obtained using the 2.07 MPa and 371°C bonding conditions.\n\n3.2.5. LARC-IA (10% PA) 50% Al. Only one bonding condition was used for LARC-IA ( 10% PA) 50% Al powder because of the results mentioned earlier for the same polymer which provided excess flow without the aluminum filler. Figure 6 shows a comparison of the LSSs for the LARC-IA 5% and 10% PA endcap with 50 wt % of aluminum powder filler. The LSSs for the 10% PA adhesive are lower than the 5% PA adhesive for all test temperatures, a similar trend obtained earlier for the same polymers without the aluminum filler. No thermal aging or water boil tests were attempted with this adhesive system.\n\n\\begin{title}\n3.3.

LSS tests were performed at RT, 177, 204 and 232°C. Strength results for LARC-TPI, reported previously, are included for comparison [2].\n\n\\begin{caption}\nLSS results for LARC-IA (10% PA) bonded Ti-6Al-4V Table 3.\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nA new flexible backbone polyimide adhesive\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{table}\n| Bonding pressure MPa (psi)   | Bonding temperature C(F)d   | Number of specimens   | Test temperature C(F)   | Average LSs MPa (psi)   | Range of LSS MPa (psi)   | Primary failure mode   |\n|:-----------------------------|:----------------------------|:----------------------|:------------------------|:------------------------|:-------------------------|:-----------------------|\n| 0.69(100)                    | 343(650)                    | 4                     | RT (RT)                 | 38.8(5630)              | 38.0-39.4(5510-5710)     | Co                     |\n| 0.69(100)                    | 343(650)                    | 4                     | 177(350)                | 26.1(3790)              | 25.6-26.8(3720-3890）    | Co                     |\n| 0.69(100)                    | 343(650)                    | 4                     | 204(400）               | 18.9(2740)              | 17.8-19.3(2580-2800)     | Co/I                   |\n| 0.69(100)                    | 343(650)                    |                       | 232（450）              | 5.4(780)                | 4.9-5.4(710-850)         | Co/I                   |\n| 2.07(300)                    | 343(650)                    | 3                     | RT(RT)                  | 37.3(5420)              | 34.3-39.4(4980-5710)     | Co                     |\n| 2.07(300)                    | 343(650)                    | 4                     | 177(350)                | 27.6(4010)              | 26.4-28.3(3830-4110)     | Co                     |\n| 2.07(300)                    | 343(650)                    | 4                     | 204(400)                | 19.3(2800)              | 16.9-21.2(2450-3070)     | Co/I                   |\n| 2.07(300)                    | 343(650)                    | 4                     | 232(450)                | 4.9(710)                | 4.0-5.7(580-830)         |                        |\n| 0.69(100)                    | 371(700）                   |                       | RT (RT)                 | 30.7(4450)              | 29.2-33.0(4240-4780)     | Co                     |\n| 0.69(100)                    | 371(700）                   | 4                     | 177(350)                | 26.6(3860)              | 25.1-27.5(3640-3990)     | Co                     |\n| 0.69(100)                    | 371(700）                   | 4                     | 204(400)                | 22.0(3190)              | 21.0-23.0(3050-3330）    | Co/I                   |\n| 0.69(100)                    | 371(700）                   | 4                     | 232(450)                | 8.1(1180)               | 7.2-8.7(1040-1260)       | Co/I                   |\n\\end{table}\n\naCo=cohesive; I=interfacial.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nLSS results for LARC-IA (5% PA) 50% Al powder bonded Ti-6Al-4V Table 4.\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nD.

Significant increases in LSS were obtained for 177, 204 and 232°C tests (177°C, from 25.5 to 29.4 MPa; 204°C, 21.1-26.2 MPa; and 232°C, 9.1-14.0 MPa). However, RT strengths decreased from 31.8 to 27.8 MPa. Further exposure at 204°C for 5000 h resulted in no change in LSS for tests conducted at 204°C (1000 h, 26.2 MPa; 5000 h, 26.9 MPa).\n\nAfter 1000 h at 204°C, the LSSs for the LARC-IA (5% PA) system decreased from 44.2 to 35.0 MPa for the RT tests and from 36.6 to 33.4 MPa for 177°C tests. LSSs at 204 and 232°C were unchanged. After the exposure for 5000 h, the RT strength decreased to 29.0 MPa, the 177°C strength decreased slightly to 30.9 MPa, the 204°C strength remained the same and the 232°C was slightly lower at 7.9 MPa. These LSSs, except for the 232°C test, are excellent considering the time and temperature of exposure. Comparing these results with LARC-TPI data, the strengths for LARC-IA (5% PA) are higher at RT, 177°C and 204°C but significantly lower than LARC-TPI at 232°C, probably due to the higher Tg of the LARC-TPI polymer.\n\nThe addition of aluminum powder filler to the 5% PA endcapped system resulted in an adhesive that retained the original strengths at all test temperatures after the 1000 h exposure. After 5000 h, the RT strength decreased from 43.8 to 34.1 MPa, the 177°C strength decreased from 33.2 to 28.3 MPa, the 204°C strength decreased from 28.7 to 24.5 MPa and the 232°C strength decreased from 13.6 to 7.7 MPa. The strengths retained after 5000 h are still excellent except for that tested at 232°C (7.7 MPa). Comparison of the 5000 h aging data of LARC-IA (5% PA) 50% Al with the LARC-TPI data indicates higher strengths at RT and 177°C, essentially the same strength at 204°C, and a lower strength at 232°C. The higher strength of LARC-TPI at 232°C is again probably due to its higher Tg.\n\nThe LARC-TPI adhesive data which had been reported earlier [2] indicated some increase in the strengths at 204 and 232°C after thermal exposure. As noted, the LSS test at 232°C was conducted after 2260 h at 232°C and still resulted in a significant increase (17.5-23.3 MPa). The strengths for the 232°C tests are much higher for the LARC-TPI than for the variations of LARC-IA primarily due to a higher Tg for LARC-TPI. The initial and 1000 h exposure strengths at RT, 177 and 204°C are higher for LARC-IA (5% PA) 50% Al than the LARC-TPI.\n\nLap shear test failures after thermal exposure were primarily cohesive except for the RT test of LARC-IA and the 232°C tests for LARC-IA (5% PA) for 1000 and 5000 h exposure which were thermoplastic (plastic deformation of the adhesive) and a combination of cohesive/interfacial, respectively.\n\n\\begin{title}\n3.4. 72-h Water boil exposure\n\\end{title}\n\nLap shear specimens were exposed to a 72-h water boil to determine the bonded system's resistance to a high humidity type condition. LSS test results are shown in Fig. 8 and given in Table 6 for the LARC-IA polymers and compared with earlier reported [2] results for LARC-TPI.\n\nMost of the adhesive systems show greatly reduced strengths for all test temperatures after the water boil exposure. Water is known to plasticize most polymers and, therefore reduce their strength properties. LARC-IA and LARC- IA (5% PA) provide results similar to the LARC-TPI.

Flatwise tensile strength and fracture energy\n\\end{title}\n\nResults of the FWT strength tests for LARC-IA (5% PA) with and without aluminum powder filler are given in Table 7 along with the fracture energy,\n\nAlthough the FWT strengths are less than expected, ranging from 1.7 to 2.6 MPa, however, they show promise since this was a preliminary attempt to prepare the specimens and not an optimization of tape preparation and bonding con- ditions. Also, core cell size influences the bond strength obtained, the smaller the cell size, the greater the contact bond area and, therefore, the greater strength. The cell size of the titanium core used to prepare these specimens was rather large, 0.95 cm. Failures were between the core cell edges and the adhesive. Minimal filleting was observed around the core cells. No apparent improvement in strength was obtained as a result of aluminum powder addition.\n\nThe fracture energy of LARC-IA (5% PA) of two specimens, 560 and 438 J/ml, was approximately double that of the LARC-IA (5% PA) 50% Al system, 298 and 210 J/ml, as determined by the DCB technique at RT.

SUMMARY\n\\end{title}\n\nThe synthesis and evaluation of a new linear, aromatic, thermoplastic polyimide, prepared from oxydiphthalic anhydride and 3,4'-oxydianiline and identified as LARC-IA, have been performed. The flow properties were optimized by con- trolling the molecular weight by use of a monofunctional anhydride, phthalic anhydride (PA). The polymer, prepared from physiologically safe and inexpensive monomers, was of interest as a possible substitute or replacement for existing expensive and possibly carcinogenic monomers used to prepare commercially available polymers.\n\nThe polymer, a high temperature thermoplastic adhesive, was evaluated using lap shear strength (LSS) tests involving adhesive tape preparation, bond condition optimization, endcapping optimization for improved flow, thermal exposure and water boil tests. A comparison was made with LARC-TPI data previously generated in our laboratory and reported earlier.\n\nLimited studies were conducted to determine mechanical properties and solvent resistance of films, composite mechanical properties, flatwise strength of adhesively bonded specimens and fracture energy of the bonded DCB specimens.\n\nThe 5% PA endcapped polymer provided the best compromise of the three polymers prepared and evaluated to optimize flow and strength properties. The addition of aluminum powder filler to the LARC-IA (5% PA) polymer enhanced the control LSS at 232°C and improved strength retention after 1000 h exposure at 204°C and a 72-h water boil. After 5000 h, the test results were essentially the same with or without the aluminum powder.\n\nPreliminary results of the flatwise tensile strength tests indicate promise for the adhesive but further improvement may be achieved with refined processing procedures.\n\nFracture energy, determined by the double cantilever beam technique for LARC-IA (5% PA) with and without aluminum powder filler, was higher than most epoxies and bismaleimides but less than the polyimidesulfones.\n\nThe LARC-IA film mechanical properties obtained were typical of linear aromatic polyimides. Film mechanical properties decreased when the film was tested near the Tg at 200°C.\n\nLARC-IA film was resistant to degradation when exposed to most of the solvents investigated, i.e. diglyme, dimethyl acetamide, m-cresol and N-methyl-2- pyrrolidone.

All polymers of the type reported here are of the type which we prefer to call polymers of limited order? Because of the lack of symmetry in the diamines used, the diamine moieties can enter the polymer chain in the manner shown or in the reverse manner. Consequently, the polymers are less ordered than those derived from similar symmetrically structured diamines;6J they are ordered to the extent that there is preferential reactivity of one amino group over the other in the diamine. For the case of complete order, the reac- tions may be illustrated by the scheme (2).\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nc12cc3c(=O)oc(=O)c3cc1c(=O)oc2=O\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nNc1ccc(-c2nc3cc(N)ccc3o2)cc1\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nNc1ccc2oc(-c3ccc(NC(=O)c4cc(C(=O)O)c(C(=O)O)cc4C(=O)Nc4ccc(-c5nc6cc(N)ccc6o5)cc4)cc3)nc2c1\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nNc1ccc(-c2nc3cc(NC(=O)c4cc(C(=O)O)c(C(=O)Nc5ccc6oc(-c7ccc(N)cc7)nc6c5)cc4C(=O)O)ccc3o2)cc1\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nc12cc3c(cc1COC2=O)C(=O)OC3=O\n\\end{molecule}\n\nOrdered benzoxazole-amide acid copolymer\n\n\\begin{molecule}\n*C=O<sep><a>0:<dum></a>\n\\end{molecule}\n\nOrdered honznvaznle.imide cnnnlumer\n\nHowever, no experimental evidence has been obtained which confirms the presence of such ordering as would result from the preferential formation of either Y or Z. Indeed, the polymer properties indicate that the degree of order from such preferential reaction, if present at all, is relatively low.\n\nBut the polymers do exhibit a form of order, inasmuch as there is a regular sequence of the benzheterocycle and imide units along the chain, i.e., the chains do not consist of alternating blocks of polybenzheterocycles and polyimides.\n\nIt is not surprising that the benzophenoneimide polymers have lower softening points than the corresponding polypyromellitimides (Table 11). The flexible >C = 0 linkage\n\n\\begin{token}\n19\\\n\\end{token}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nNOTES\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFig. 1.

TGA of polymer of I1 in nitrogen and in air.\n\\end{caption}\n\ncoupled with the random placement of the diamine moiety in the repeat unit undoubtedly accounts for the low softening points observed for certain examples of these polymers; e.g., VII, IX, and X. The good packing8 which can be achieved by the relatively com- pact and rigid pyromellitimide units apparently overcomes to a large extent any tendency of the polymers containing pyromellitimide units to soften because of any lack of order in the placement of the diamine moiety in t,he polymer repeating unit.\n\nFor both the pyromellitimide and benzopherioneimide copolymers of limited order, the thermal stability is surprisingly good in view of the disorder present in these poly- mers. The results of thermal analyses are shown in Table I1 and a typical differential t-hermal analysis (DTA) curve of fiber of I1 is shown in Figure 1. A typical thermo- gravimetric analysis (TGA), Figure 2, shows that polymer I1 retains its weight equally well in nitrogen or air to about 600°C.\n\n\\begin{title}\n3032 JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE: PART A-1, VOL. 7\n\\end{title}\n\nThe range of decomposition temperatures for the benzheterocycie-imide copolymers is remarkably narrow, considering the variations in structure (Table 11). This character- istic of heterocycle-imide copolymers was noted by us earlier for completely ordered heterocycle-imide copolymers6 and is greatly different from that of heterocycle-amide copolymers in which the decomposition temperature is highly dependent on structure. Interestingly, in the series of benzheterocycle-imide copolymers studied the temperature at which serious degradation of the imide bond begins wfts not found to be dependent on the softening point of the polymer, as is shown by the fact that many of the benz- heterocycle-benzophenone-imides show softening near 30OoC, but decompose at no lower a temperature than the benzheterocycle-pyromellitimides which do not soften below 540-575OC. This contrasts sharply with the temperature of thermal degradation of tbe amide bond of high melting aromatic polyamides. The degradation temperature of such polyamides was found to be highly dependent on the softening point of the polymer.' It is believed that in the case of aromatic polyimides, the relative insensi- tivity of the decomposition temperature to the softening temperature will prove to be quite general. Also noteworthy is the narrow melting point range for the group of benzheterocycle-pyromellitimide copolymers (Table 11).\n\nTo gauge the end-use performance of a typical copolymer, film of I1 was heabaged in air at elevated temperatures along with film of a commercially important polyimide, the polypyromellitimide of bis(4aminophenyl) ether (XII);O the results- obtained\n\n\\begin{molecule}\n*c1ccc(Oc2ccc(-n3c(=O)c4cc5c(=O)n(*)c(=O)c5cc4c3=O)cc2)cc1\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nXI1\n\\end{legend}\n\nare given in Table 111. The changes in weight for films of I1 and XI1 on isothermal heabaging in air are shown in Figure 3.\n\nFdms of all of the benzheterocycle-imide polymers I-XI have good physical properties and most exhibit outstanding thermal stability. On the other hand, fibers (25 den/ filame'nt) of 11, although highly lustrous and well-collapsed, have relatively poor physical properties: tenacity, 2.8 g/den; elongation, 25%; initial modulus, 130 g/den; lack of complete order undoubtably is the dominant factor responsible for the poor fiber properties, since fibers of excellent tensile strength have been prepared from completely ordered benzheterocycle-imide copolymers1° which contain the same type structural units used for this benzheterocycle-imide copolymer of limited order. On the other hand, the imperfect order may actually be responsible for the good film properties\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTABLE I11 Comparative Effects of Heat Aging of a Benzheterocyclepyromellitimide Polymer and a Simple Pyromellitimide in Air8\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{table}\n| Exposure conditions   | Exposure conditions   | Effect on Film   | Effect on Film         |\n|:----------------------|:----------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------|\n| Temp, C               | Time, hr              | Ib               | XIIc                   |\n| 350                   | 100                   | No change        | Dark, brittle          |\n| 350                   | 200                   | SI. brittle      | V. brittle             |\n| 375                   | 48                    | No change        | Dark, brittle          |\n| 375                   | 120                   | No change        | Carbonized, fell apart |\n\\end{table}\n\n* Comparative tests were run side by side. b A benzoxaeole-pyromellitimide polymer (Table 11). 0 Polypyromellitimide of bis(4aminophenyl)ether.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nNOTES\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFig. 3.

Especially in active optical components like TO switches, polarization dependent behaviors are caused by d(Dn)/dT of materials. Origins of polarization dependence of TO coefﬁcient were investigated for seven kinds of polyimide (PI) ﬁlms in terms of main chain orientation and residual thermal stress. The values of d(Dn)/dT of PI ﬁlms originated from chain orientation vary from nil to negative as the degrees of in-plane orientation increase. Magnitudes of d(Dn)/dT depend on intrinsic birefringences, second order orientation coefﬁcients, and their temperature dependence. On the other hand, those of d(Dn)/dT originated from residual stress are negative for PI ﬁlms exhibiting large in-plane coefﬁcients of thermal expansion (CTE) and vary to zero as their CTE decreases due to reduced residual stress. d(Dn)/dT originating from chain orientation decreases as the degree of chain orientation increases, but that from residual thermal stress increases, which is the reason that no apparent trend was observed for the d(Dn)/dT of PI ﬁlms adhering to Si substrates. Based on these examinations, the d(Dn)/dT of on-substrate PI ﬁlms were successfully decreased to the levels of peeled PI ﬁlms by incorporation of alicyclic structures in the main chains and/or the use of PI substrates whose CTEs are close to those of PI ﬁlms.

INTRODUCTION\n\\end{title}\n\nThe thermo-optic (TO) effect (i.e., temperature- dependent change in the refractive index) in optical polymers has recently attracted much attention because this phenom- enon is essential for all optical materials and can be utilized to fabricate active optical waveguide components such as TO optical switches and tunable wavelength-division multi- plexers.1,2 In particular, the temperature gradient of the refrac- tive index (dn/dT) of transparent polymeric materials3–11 is one order of magnitude larger ( 1 102ppm/K) than that of silica glass12 (þ10 ppm/K). By using polymeric materials, power consumptions of such active waveguide components can be signiﬁcantly reduced due to their large jdn/dTj. Thereby, quantitative estimations and control of dn/dTs and their polarization dependence of polymers are crucial for fab- ricating active waveguide components using optical polymers.\n\nFor optically transparent polymers, the relationship between their average refractive indices (nav) and their tem- perature gradients (dnav/dT) can be expressed by the temper- ature derivative of the Lorentz-Lorenz formula\n\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\frac{d n_{\\mathrm{a v}}} {d T}}=-\\, {\\frac{\\left( n_{\\mathrm{a v}}^{2}-1 \\right) \\left( n_{\\mathrm{a v}}^{2}+2 \\right)} {6 n_{\\mathrm{a v}}}} \\, \\beta,\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{token}\n(1)\n\\end{token}\n\nwhere T is the temperature, and b is the volumetric thermal expansion coefﬁcient of materials. This is because the tem- perature dependence of molecular polarizability is negligibly\n\na)Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Electronic mail: sando@polymer.titech.ac.jp.

(1), the values of dnav/dT of polymers are always negative due to their positive b, and a large nav and/ or a large b give a large jdnav/dTj.\n\nAmong a number of polymeric materials for optical applications, we focused on the TO effects in aromatic polyi- mides (PIs) due to their favorable properties for thermally stable optical waveguide applications.15–17 We have been developing a variety of passive optical devices and compo- nents such as single-mode waveguides,18 waveplates,19–21 and polarizers22–24 using partially ﬂuorinated and perﬂuori- nated PIs. In addition, regarding to TO effects in PIs, we have reported that the dnav/dT of aromatic PIs can be con- trolled by introducing sulﬁde (–S–) and disulﬁde (–S–S–) linkages into the main chains, which is effective to endow large jdnav/dTj to optical polymers.25 On the other hand, we have also reported that PI ﬁlms formed on Si substrates ex- hibit signiﬁcant polarization dependence in dn/dT,26 which indicates that the absolute values of dn/dT observed for transverse electric (TE) polarization (parallel to the ﬁlm plane) are signiﬁcantly larger than those for transverse mag- netic (TM) polarization (perpendicular to the ﬁlm plane). This polarization dependence may cause undesirable insta- bility in the performance of active waveguide components such as TO switches.\n\nIn this study, we deﬁne the polarization dependence of dn/dT as the difference between the values of dn/dT for in-plane and out-of-plane refractive indices (nTE and nTM, respectively), which are equal to the temperature dependence of in-plane/out-of-plane birefringence (Dn)\n\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\frac{d n_{\\mathrm{T E}}} {d T}}-{\\frac{d n_{\\mathrm{T M}}} {d T}}={\\frac{d ( n_{\\mathrm{T E}}-n_{\\mathrm{T M}} )} {d T}}={\\frac{d ( \\Delta n )} {d T}},\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{token}\n(2)\n\\end{token}\n\nd(Dn)/dT causes polarization dependence in the properties of active waveguide components.1 Figure 1 shows schematic views of a TO switch made by polymer waveguides and the inﬂuence of polarization dependence of dn/dT on the switch- ing performance. If the jdnTM/dTj of the waveguide core is signiﬁcantly smaller than the jdnTE/dTj, the refractive index change needed for complete switching of TM-polarized sig- nals is not achieved, a critical condition for TE signals, which leads to additional heating of the waveguide core. Thereby, d(Dn)/dT is expected to be minimized or optimally eliminated in most waveguide applications. The present authors have been exploring methods to control the dn/dT and d(Dn)/dT of PI ﬁlms formed on Si substrates and have reported that some PI ﬁlms having very small Dn, represent- ing small degrees of chain orientation, exhibit negative values of d(Dn)/dT due to the temperature dependence of stress-birefringence originating from a mismatch of coefﬁ- cients of linear thermal expansion (CTE) between PI ﬁlms and Si substrates.27 Based on these ﬁndings, we have achieved a 30%–50% decrease in d(Dn)/dT of PI ﬁlms by replacing aromatic rings with alicyclic structures, which is attributable to the effective reduction of the stress-optical coefﬁcient. However, these semi-alicyclic PI ﬁlms still exhibit appreciable d(Dn)/dT, which are two or more times larger than those for PI ﬁlms peeled off from the substrates. We would like to develop new and facile methods for the effective reduction of the d(Dn)/dT of PI ﬁlms.\n\nApart from such approaches to control d(Dn)/dT, there remains an important issue to be clariﬁed: the reason why d(Dn)/dT values do not exhibit simple correlations with other properties such as Dn, residual stress, or anisotropy in CTE, when PI ﬁlms are formed on Si substrates.26 In this study, we investigate the effects of chain orientation and residual ther- mal stress on d(Dn)/dT and propose a theoretical basis that\n\n\\begin{legend}\n1) TE polarization (no crosstalk)\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\n2) TM polarization (small crosstalk)\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFIG. 1.

When one of the cores in the Y-branched waveguides is heated by a metallic heater, the refractive index is decreased to shut off optical sig- nals. However, if jdnTM/dTj of the core material is signiﬁcantly smaller than the jdnTE/dTj, a refractive index change needed for complete switching of TM-polarized signals is not achieved, even though TE-polarized signals are completely switched without crosstalk.\n\\end{caption}\n\nquantitatively explains the origins of d(Dn)/dT for PI ﬁlms formed on substrates. In addition, we demonstrate two facile and effective approaches to reduce the d(Dn)/dT for on- substrate PI ﬁlms to the levels of those for off-substrate ones.\n\n\\begin{title}\nII. EXPERIMENTAL\n\\end{title}\n\n\\begin{title}\nA. Sample preparation\n\\end{title}\n\nThin ﬁlms of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) obtained from Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd. (Sumipex- MGSS, optical grade) were prepared by spin-coating of a toluene solution. The spin-coated PMMA solution was dried at 40 C/20 min, 65 C/20 min, and 80 C/20 min in a convec- tion oven, followed by annealing at 120 C under reduced pressure. Aromatic PI ﬁlms were prepared by thermal imid- ization of their precursors, poly(amic acid)s (PAAs). The molecular structures of aromatic PIs used in this study are shown in Figure 2. The PAA solutions were prepared by pol- ycondensations of equimolar dianhydrides and diamines in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc). Alicyclic PI ﬁlms were prepared from corresponding poly(amic acid trimethylsilyl ester) (PASE) solutions using the in situ silylation method.28 These precursor solutions were spin-coated on Si substrates (4-in. diameter, 380 lm thick, (001) surface) and dried at 70 C for 30 min, followed by thermal imidization for 1 h under nitrogen ﬂow. The imidization temperatures were 350 C for aromatic PIs and 300 C for alicyclic PIs. The val- ues of d(Dn)/dT were measured for ﬁlms in two conditions, (1) ﬁlms formed on Si substrates (on-substrate ﬁlms) and (2) those peeled off from the substrates prior to measurement (off-substrate ﬁlms). The residual stress in the off-substrate PI ﬁlms was effectively released by annealing at above the imidization temperature. The thicknesses of PMMA and PI ﬁlms used for measurements were controlled in a range of 12–15 lm. Thick substrates made of Kapton-type aromatic PI with a 4-in. diameter and 0.7-mm thickness were kindly supplied by NTT Advanced Technology Corp.\n\n\\begin{molecule}\n*N(C(=O)C)C(=O)*.*N(C(=O)C)C(=O)C<sep><a>0:<dum></a><a>7:<dum></a><a>8:dene</a>\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nCc1ccc(C(c2ccc(C)c(C)c2)(C(F)(F)F)C(F)(F)F)cc1C\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{legend}\n16FDA\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nCc1ccc(Oc2ccc(C)c(C)c2)cc1C\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{legend}\n2ODPA\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nCc1cc(C)c(C)cc1C\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{legend}\n3PMDA\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nCc1ccc(-c2ccc(C)c(C)c2)cc1C\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{legend}\n4BPDA\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFIG. 2.

Variable temperature measurements of refractive indices\n\\end{title}\n\nA prism coupler (Metricon, PC-2010) equipped with a home-made temperature-control apparatus (See the Appendix) was used for refractive index measurements at elevated temperatures.25–27 Linearly polarized CW laser beams with TE (transverse electric) and TM (transverse magnetic) polarization were used for the measurements of nTE (refractive index in the in-plane direction of ﬁlms) and nTM (out-of-plane direction, normal to ﬁlm surface), respectively. The average refractive index and in-plane/ out-of-plane birefringences of polymer ﬁlms were calcu- lated according to the following equations:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nn_{\\mathrm{a v}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 n_{\\mathrm{T E}}^{2}+n_{\\mathrm{T M}}^{2}} {3}},\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta n=n_{\\mathrm{T E}}-n_{\\mathrm{T M}}.\n\\end{equation}\n\nA near-infrared laser at a wavelength of 1.324 lm was used as the light source to avoid anomalous dispersion of refractive indices near the absorption edges. The refractive index (n) of the coupling prism made of gallium gadolinium garnet at each temperature was estimated using the values of n ¼ 1.9387 at 25 C and dn/dT ¼ þ17.2 ppm/K at 1.324 lm.29 The measurements were carried out under a dry atmosphere ( 20% relative humidity) and in a temperature range of 85 C to 35 C. The sample temperature was controlled in descending order to prevent moisture absorption. A very small amount of silicone oil was used as a lubricant for the off-substrate ﬁlms/heating plate and the ﬁlm/prism surfaces in order to suppress thermal stress caused by the CTE mis- match among the substrates, a prism, and PI ﬁlms. Prior to the variable temperature experiments, the accuracy of tem- perature control was checked for this measurement system. The reliability of temperature control of the prism and the sample were 63 C in the worst case. The experimental errors in the refractive indices and d(Dn)/dT were estimated as 60.0003 and 65 ppm/K, respectively.\n\n\\begin{title}\nC.

The temperature dependence of r (dr/dT) was estimated in a tem- perature range of 80–140 C using a home-made heating attachment for the proﬁler. The measurements were carried out under a dry atmosphere ( 20% relative humidity) to avoid the stress relaxation derived from moisture absorption.

TO coefficients of polymer films formed on Si substrates\n\\end{title}\n\nFigure 3 shows the temperature dependence of nTE and nTM of a PMMA ﬁlm formed on a Si substrate. The ﬁlm was optically isotropic because both the birefringence (Dn ¼ nTE nTM) and its temperature dependence (d(Dn)/dT ¼ dnTE/dT dnTM/dT) were very small, which are compara- ble to the experimental error range. The refractive index of PMMA decreases as the temperature increases owing to its volumetric thermal expansion (b). It should be noted that the dnav/dT for PMMA ﬁlm formed on a Si substrate ( 88 ppm/K) is smaller than that for a PMMA bulk prism4 ( 120 ppm/K) in their absolute values. The smaller jdnav/dTj value for the on-substrate ﬁlm is attributed to restrained thermal expansions due to very small CTE of Si(001) substrates (þ2.6 ppm/K). The restraint leads to small apparent thermal volume expansion (b’) of polymer ﬁlms attached to substrates, which result in small jdnav/dTjs according to Eq. (1). In case the polymer ﬁlms are formed on substrate having negligibly small CTE, the TO coefﬁ- cient of polymer ﬁlms can be estimated as follows:1\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\left. \\frac{d n_{a \\nu}} {d T} \\right|_{\\mathrm{o n \\, s u b s t r a t e}}=\\frac{1} {3} \\left( \\frac{1+\\nu} {1-\\nu} \\right) \\! \\frac{d n_{\\mathrm{a v}}} {d T} |_{\\mathrm{b u l k}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{token}\n(6)\n\\end{token}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFIG. 3. Temperature dependence of in-plane and out-of-plane refractive indices (nTE and nTM, respectively) of PMMA ﬁlm formed on Si substrate.\n\\end{caption}\n\nwhere is the Poisson ratio of the polymer. Using the values of for PMMA33 (0.365) and dnav/dT for bulk PMMA ( 120 ppm/K), the dnav/dT for on-substrate PMMA ﬁlm is estimated at 86 ppm/K, which is very close to the experi- mental dnav/dT in the present study. This result conﬁrms the reliability of our measurement system of TO coefﬁcients.\n\nThe temperature dependence of in-plane and out-of- plane refractive indices of a ﬂuorinated aromatic PI 1a (6FDA/ODA) ﬁlm formed on a Si substrate is shown in Figure 4. Unlike the case of PMMA, aromatic PI ﬁlms exhib- ited signiﬁcantly large polarization dependence of TO coefﬁ- cients (d(Dn)/dT). In order to investigate the molecular- structure dependence, the polarization dependences of dn/dT were measured for seven kinds of aromatic PI ﬁlms formed on Si substrates, and the estimated values of d(Dn)/dT are listed in Table I. Investigation of the molecular-structure de- pendence of dnav/dT is made in this section, and that of d(Dn)/dT will be discussed in Sec. III B.\n\nTo analyze the relationship according to Eq. (1), the val- ues of (nav 2 1)(nav 2þ 1)/6nav are plotted against dnav/dT for the PI ﬁlms formed on Si substrates (Figure 5). Because the term of (nav 2 1)(nav 2þ 1)/6nav is nearly proportional to nav in the range of 1.4 < nav < 1.8, the absolute values of dnav/dT (jdnav/dTj) tend to increase as the nav increases. However, the correlation in Figure 5 is unclear due to the dif- ferences in volumetric expansion among PIs. Coefﬁcients of apparent volumetric thermal expansion (b’), estimated from nav and dnav/dT according to Eq. (1), are in a range of 100 6 20 ppm/K. In cases of PI ﬁlms exhibiting small bire- fringence with lower degrees of in-plane orientation of main chains (PI 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b), the PIs derived from ODA diamine (PI 1a and 2a), which includes a bent and ﬂexible ether (-O-) linkage, exhibit larger b’ than those derived from a linear and rigid TFDB diamine (PI 1b and 2b). This suggests that a bent and ﬂexible structure in the main chain leads to an increase in b’. On the other hand, the PI ﬁlms exhibiting large birefringence with higher degrees of in-plane orienta- tion (PI 3a, 3b, 4c) did not necessarily demonstrate small b’values despite their rigid structures. These PIs should ex- hibit small CTEs parallel to the ﬁlm plane, and the restraint of thermal expansions caused by a CTE mismatch between PI ﬁlm and the Si substrate should be small compared to the PI ﬁlms with lower degrees of orientation.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFIG. 4.

Origins of polarization dependence of TO coefficient\n\\end{title}\n\nAs described above, signiﬁcant polarization dependence has been observed for the TO coefﬁcients of PI ﬁlms formed on Si substrates.27 The experimental values of d(Dn)/dT are plotted against Dn in Figure 6. For the off-substrate ﬁlms (squares), the jdnav/dTj values increase as the Dn increase, which readily indicates that a higher degree of chain orienta- tion leads to a large value of jd(Dn)/dTj. In contrast, those for the on-substrate ﬁlms (triangles) do not exhibit clear cor- relations to Dn.\n\nIn general, birefringence Dn in polymer depends on polymer chain orientation and residual stress. At ﬁrst, we clarify the relationships between the experimental values of Dn and d(Dn)/dT and the degree of chain orientation for the off-substrate PI ﬁlms to investigate the orientation-driven d(Dn)/dT. The Dn in a rotationally symmetric system is pro- portional to the second order orientation coefﬁcient (P200) of polymer chains. In the case of uniaxially drawn ﬁlms or ﬁbers, chain orientation direction coincides with the axis of symmetry, and Dn can be expressed as34\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta n=\\Delta n^{0} \\times P_{2 0 0},\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere Dn0 is the intrinsic birefringence. In contrast, spin- coated ﬁlms can be treated as biaxially drawn ﬁlms, in which the axis of symmetry is normal to the ﬁlm plane, and the polymer chains are oriented perpendicular to the axis of\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFIG. 5.

Thereby, the relationship between Dn (¼nTE nTM) and P200 for spin-coated ﬁlms is expressed as follows:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta n=-\\Delta n^{0} \\times P_{2 0 0}.\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{token}\n(7b)\n\\end{token}\n\nBy taking the temperature derivative of Eq. (7b), the rela- tionship between d(Dn)/dT and the chain orientation is expressed as follows:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\frac{d ( \\Delta n )} {d T}}=-P_{2 0 0} {\\frac{d ( \\Delta n^{0} )} {d T}}-\\Delta n^{0} {\\frac{d P_{2 0 0}} {d T}}.\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{token}\n(8)\n\\end{token}\n\nAccording to Eq. (8), the inﬂuence of chain orientation on d(Dn)/dT can be divided into two factors; (a) the temperature dependence of Dn0 (product of P200 and d(Dn0)/dT) and (b) the temperature dependence of P200 (product of Dn0 and dP200/dT). For quantitative investigation of d(Dn)/dT, the values of P200, Dn0, and their temperature dependences are to be evaluated. We have previously reported P200 for PI ﬁlms prepared by spin-coating35 and uniaxial drawing36 using polarized ATR/FT-IR spectroscopy, and their Dn0 val- ues were determined.37 However, the origins of their temper- ature dependence have not been investigated yet.\n\nFirst, we investigate the temperature dependences of Dn0. Intrinsic birefringence Dn0 can be estimated according to the Vuks equation38\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{n_{i}^{2}-1} {n_{\\mathrm{a v}}^{2}+2}=\\frac{4 \\pi} {3} \\frac{\\rho N_{\\mathrm{A}}} {M} \\, \\alpha_{i},\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{token}\n(9)\n\\end{token}\n\nwhere ni, ai, q, M, and NA are the refractive index, the molec- ular polarizability for a direction i, the density of a polymer, the molecular weight of the repeating unit, and the Avogadro’s number, respectively. From the temperature de- rivative of Eq. (9), the temperature dependence of ni can be written as follows:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\frac{2 n_{i}} {n_{i}^{2}-1}} {\\frac{d n_{i}} {d T}}-{\\frac{2 n_{\\mathrm{a v}}} {n_{\\mathrm{a v}}^{2}+2}} {\\frac{d n_{\\mathrm{a v}}} {d T}}={\\frac{1} {\\rho}} {\\frac{d \\rho} {d T}}=-\\beta.\n\\end{equation}\n\nIn the derivation of Eq. (10), the temperature dependence of polarizability (dai/dT) was neglected because dai/dT is much smaller than dq/dT for polymers.4 In accordance with Eqs. (1) and (10), the temperature dependence of Dn0 is approximated as\n\n\\begin{token}\n(10)\n\\end{token}\n\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\frac{d ( \\Delta n^{0} )} {d T}}=\\left( 1+{\\frac{1} {n_{| |}^{0} n_{\\bot}^{0}}} \\right) {\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{a v}}} {n_{\\mathrm{a v}}^{2}-1}} \\Delta n^{0} {\\frac{d n_{\\mathrm{a v}}} {d T}},\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere njj 0 and n? 0 are the refractive indices parallel and per- pendicular to the axis of symmetry under perfect uniaxial orientation, in which P200 becomes unity. The values of d(Dn0)/dT estimated from the experimental values of njj 0, n? 0, and Dn0, and those of dnav/dT measured for the off- substrate PI ﬁlms are listed in Table II. Among the four kinds of aromatic PIs, 4c (BPDA/PDA) exhibited exceptionally large d(Dn0)/dT due to its high nav and large Dn0 values.\n\nSecond, we investigate the temperature dependences of P200. P200 represents a degree of orientation of polymer chains to the axis of symmetry, which is deﬁned as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nP_{2 0 0}=\\frac{3 \\langle\\cos^{2} \\! \\theta\\rangle-1} {2},\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere h is the angle between a polymer main chain and the axis of symmetry, and the value in the angle bracket means the average over all polymer segments. In cases of spin- coated ﬁlms, the main chains of aromatic PIs tend to orient perpendicular to the axis of symmetry due to their rigid and quasi-linear skeletal structures. Thereby, the values of P200 vary from 1 (h ¼ 0, isotropic) to 1/2 (h ¼ p/2; all chains are oriented parallel to the ﬁlm plane) as the degree of chain ori- entation increases. PI ﬁlms exhibiting anisotropic CTEs will cause changes in h with temperature. According to Eq. (12), changes in h will cause temperature dependences of P200. The CTEs parallel to the orientation direction usually take positive values, but they become negative in some cases of rigid-rod polymers. In addition, it decreases by increasing the degree of in-plane chain orientation. The variation of h originating from the anisotropy in CTE is schematically shown in Figure 7. It can be assumed that an angle Dh, which represents the change in h caused by elevated temperature DT, sufﬁces in the following relation:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\operatorname{t a n} ( \\theta+\\Delta\\theta)=\\frac{1+k_{| |} \\Delta T} {1+k_{\\perp} \\Delta T} \\operatorname{t a n} \\theta\\approx( 1-\\Delta k \\Delta T ) \\operatorname{t a n} \\theta,\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere kjj and k? are the CTEs parallel and perpendicular to the axis of symmetry, respectively, and Dk (¼kjj k?) is the anisotropy in CTE. According to Eqs. (12) and (13), the change in the orientation coefﬁcients (DP200) after a temper- ature change (DT) can be estimated as follows:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta P_{2 0 0}=3 \\Delta k \\Delta T ( \\langle\\operatorname{c o s}^{2} \\! \\theta\\rangle-\\langle\\operatorname{c o s}^{4} \\! \\theta\\rangle)\n\\end{equation}\n\nTABLE II.

In this study, we approximated hcos4hi by hcos2hi2, which corresponds to a case where all polymer chains take the same h value on average. The experimental Dk, P200, and the dP200/dT estimated using Eq. (15) for the off-substrate PI ﬁlms are listed in Table III. The PIs exhibit- ing large Dk represent relatively large dP200/dT. In general, a higher degree of chain orientation leads to a large Dk, but PI 4c exhibits an intermediate Dk value (119 ppm/K) because its rigid structure with a higher degree of molecular aggrega- tion leads to smaller volumetric thermal expansion. Hence, the dP200/dT of PI 4c is not so large despite the highest degree of chain orientation (P200 ¼ 0.330).\n\nTemperature dependences of d(Dn)/dT for PI ﬁlms are estimated using Eqs. (8), (11), and (15). Both of the esti- mated and experimental values of d(Dn)/dT for the off- substrate PI ﬁlms are always negative, as listed in Table IV, and their absolute values are signiﬁcantly large for ﬁlms exhibiting higher degrees of orientation (3b and 4c). As shown in Figure 8, the estimated values of d(Dn)/dT well reproduce the experimental ones, which apparently demon- strates that the experimental values of d(Dn)/dT observed for the off-substrate PI ﬁlms are explainable as a sum of the two factors (a) and (b).\n\nWe start investigation on residual stress effect on Dn and d(Dn)/dT.

Based on the experi- mental results, we have reported that the difference in d(Dn)/ dT between the off- and on-substrate ﬁlms is caused by the temperature dependence of stress birefringence (d(Dns)/dT) for the PI ﬁlms exhibiting lower degrees of chain orientation, and this term can be represented as follows:1,27\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{d ( \\Delta n_{\\mathrm{s}} )} {d T}=C_{\\mathrm{G}}^{\\prime} \\frac{d \\sigma} {d T},\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere C0 G is the in-plane/out-of-plane stress-optical coefﬁ- cient for biaxial stress, and r is the residual stress (positive for expansion stress). The temperature dependence of r can be expressed as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{d \\sigma} {d T}=\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{f}}} {1-\\nu_{\\mathrm{f}}} \\left( k_{\\mathrm{f}}-k_{\\mathrm{s}} \\right),\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere Ef, f, kf, and ks are Young’s modulus, the Poisson ra- tio, the in-plane CTEs of PI ﬁlm and substrate, respec- tively.39,40 The values of d(Dns)/dT for the oriented PI ﬁlms were estimated according to Eq. (16) using the experimental values of C0 G and dr/dT as listed in Table V. Since residual stress is induced in the on-substrate PI ﬁlms during cooling from the highest imidization temperature (300–350 C) to room temperature,41 the value of dr/dT becomes small (close to zero) when kf is similar to ks (2.6 ppm/K at 20 C), and they become negative when the values of kf are negative. On the other hand, the estimated C0 G for the PI ﬁlms are in a range of 100–280 ppm/MPa, which are much larger than those for conventional optical polymers such as PMMA and polystyrene. This is due to the higher content of benzene and imide rings in the molecular structures of PIs.42 As shown in\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFIG. 8.

This result clearly certiﬁes that the temperature dependence of stress birefringence d(Dns)/dT causes the substrate effect on d(Dn)/dT for PI ﬁlms.\n\n\\begin{title}\nC. Control of polarization dependence of TO coefficients\n\\end{title}\n\nThe reduction of polarization dependence of dn/dT in polymer ﬁlms is an essential issue to improve the perform- ance of active waveguide components. Since the structures of optical materials applicable to waveguides are more or less isotropic with low degrees of chain orientation and ex- hibit negligibly small Dn, the dominant origin of d(Dn)/dT could be “stress-driven” polarization dependence of the TO coefﬁcient (d(Dns)/dT). According to Eqs. (16) and (17), d(Dns)/dT can be effectively reduced by (i) elimination of the mismatch between the CTEs of substrates and PI ﬁlms (kf ks) and (ii) reduction of the stress-optical coefﬁcients (C0 Gs) of PI ﬁlms.\n\nAt ﬁrst we investigate an approach to reduce CTE mis- match by using PI substrates. The CTEs of conventional inorganic substrate materials (e.g., silicon, sapphire, and silica glass) are generally much smaller than those of poly- mers. If we can choose substrates from other than inorganic materials, the CTE of substrate ks becomes more controllable for reducing the CTE mismatch with polymers. For instance, several kinds of polymeric substrates have been proposed for\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFIG. 9. Comparison between the d(Dn)/dT induced by the use of Si substrate (open symbols) and the estimated values of temperature dependence of stress birefringence d(Dns)/dT for the on-substrate PI ﬁlms on Si substrates (ﬁlled symbols).\n\\end{caption}\n\noptical waveguide applications.43,44 Since the kss of these substrates could be close to the kf of optical PIs, the d(Dns)/ dT spontaneously generated in PI ﬁlms should be signiﬁ- cantly reduced by using polymeric substrates. Therefore, in this study, we employed a polyimide substrate with ks of 60 ppm/K, which is almost same as the kfs of the ﬂuorinated PIs developed for waveguide applications (PI 1a and 1b, see Table III). The values of dnav/dT and d(Dn)/dT measured for the PI ﬁlms formed on PI substrates are shown in Table VI. As we had expected, the d(Dn)/dT for the PI ﬁlms formed on the PI substrates were effectively reduced, as small as those for the off-substrate PI ﬁlms. In addition, the PI ﬁlms on PI substrates exhibited almost the same dnav/dT as the off- substrate ﬁlms, which obviously conﬁrm that the thermal expansion of PI ﬁlms was not restrained by the PI substrates due to the absence of a CTE mismatch (cf. Sec. III). The major advantage of this approach is that the signiﬁcant d(Dn)/dT in the current PIs developed for waveguide appli- cations can be effectively reduced without any modiﬁcations of the molecular structures.\n\nSecond, we investigate an approach to reduce C0 G of PIs. In photonic and telecommunication applications, the selec- tion of substrate materials for optical waveguides has been limited to inorganics such as Si, sapphire (Al2O3), or fused silica glass (SiO2). Although the kf of PI ﬁlms can be reduced to as small as ks of inorganic materials through enhancement of the degrees of chain orientation,45–47 it readily induces signiﬁcantly large Dn and orientation-driven d(Dn)/dT, which inevitably deteriorates the performance of wave- guides, i.e., polarization dependent optical losses and phase shift between TE and TM signals. Therefore, in case opti- cally isotropic PI ﬁlms are formed on inorganic substrates, their large CTE mismatch and accompanying large dr/dTs are to be minimized. According to Eq. (16), C0 G could be reduced to achieve a small jd(Dn)/dTj for PI ﬁlms which ex- hibit large dr/dT values. Although the origins of the molecular-structure dependence of C0 G have not been quanti- tatively clariﬁed, a large anisotropy in molecular polarizabil- ity along the chain axis should lead to a large C0 G.42 Hence, introductions of ﬂexible and non-planer aliphatic structures could effectively reduce the d(Dn)/dT of PIs. In order to ver- ify this concept, two series of aliphatic PIs were prepared (Figure 10); (a) semi-alicyclic PIs derived from alicyclic dia- mines (d: DCHM, e: 6FDC, f: TFDC) and aromatic dianhy- drides (1: 6FDA and 2: ODPA), and (b) wholly alicyclic PIs derived from the same alicyclic diamines and alicyclic\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTABLE VI.

The experimental values of d(Dn)/ dT for these alicyclic PI ﬁlms formed on Si substrates are shown in Figure 11. The absolute values of d(Dn)/dT for the semi-alicyclic PIs (PI 1d–1f and 2d–2f) are signiﬁcantly reduced by 30%–50% compared to the aromatic PIs derived from the same dianhydrides. Furthermore, the wholly alicy- clic PIs (PI 5d–5f) exhibited very small d(Dn)/dT ( 3– 9 ppm/K), despite the use of Si substrates. The d(Dn)/dT for these PI ﬁlms are as small as those for the off-substrate aro- matic PI ﬁlms without residual stress. The kinked and stiff structure of the CBDA moiety provides additional reduction in anisotropy of polarizability.\n\nIn addition to the very small jd(Dn)/dTj, the values of dnav/dT of the alicyclic PI ﬁlms can also be controlled through their molecular structures. As shown in Figure 12, the jdnav/dTj for the PIs derived from ﬂuorinated alicyclic diamines 6FDC (PI 1e, 2e, and 5e) and TFDC (1f, 2f, and 5f) are reduced further than those of the PIs derived from DCHM (1d, 2d, and 5d) by 25%–50%. According to Eq. (1), a small jdnav/dTj is attributable to small values of nav and/or b. Although the nav of the PIs derived from 6FDC and TFDC are smaller than those of the PIs from DCHM by 0.02–0.04, the differences in nav cause only 5%–10% decreases in dnav/dT. Therefore, the PIs derived from 6FDC- and TFDC\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFIG. 11.

In the case of TFDC-derived PIs, small b may be attributable to the relatively linear structure of the TFDC moiety, whereas the difference between the molecular structures of the DCHM and 6FDC moieties is the only ﬂexible linkages connecting the two cyclohexyl units (the methylene unit –CH2– and the hexaﬂuoroisopropylidene unit –C(CF3)2–, respectively) as shown in Figure 10. In the case of 6FDC- derived PIs, the bulky and heavy triﬂuoromethyl (–CF3) side groups cause steric hindrance and make the main-chain rota- tions more difﬁcult. This assumption is supported by the molecular-structure dependence of glass transition tempera- tures (Tg) shown in Table VII. The 6FDC-derived PIs (1e and 2e) exhibit noticeably higher Tgs than the DCHM- derived ones (1d and 2d). In addition, a similar trend is observed in the dianhydride-structure dependence of Tgs. The 6FDA-derived PIs, containing –C(CF3)2– linkages, exhibit signiﬁcantly higher Tgs than the ODPA-derived PIs (containing –O– linkages). This trend demonstrates that, among the three kinds of ﬂexible linkages, –C(CF3)2– leads to more restricted main-chain motions compared to –CH2– and –O– linkages.\n\n\\begin{title}\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\\end{title}\n\nThe relationships between the polarization dependence of TO coefﬁcients (d(Dn)/dT) and other properties (e.g., bire- fringence Dn, orientation coefﬁcient P200, or residual stress r) were extensively examined for the on-substrate and off- substrate PI ﬁlms, and the origins of d(Dn)/dT were clariﬁed. It was demonstrated that the d(Dn)/dT can be divided into two factors, that is, (a) chain orientation-driven and (b) stress-driven ones. The former factor (a) consists of two terms, the temperature dependence of Dn0 and P200, as\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTABLE VII.

(8). The value of d(Dn)/dT derived from this factor is always negative and signiﬁcantly large for ﬁlms exhibiting higher degrees of chain orientation. On the other hand, the latter factor (b) is caused by the temperature de- pendence of stress birefringence (drs/dT). The value of d(Dn)/dT derived from this factor is also negative for ﬁlms exhibiting large in-plane CTEs, which is the case with lower degrees of chain orientation. However, the d(Dn)/dT becomes small and close to zero as the in-plane CTE decreases because the drs/dT depends on the CTE mismatch between the PI ﬁlms and Si substrates, as shown in Eqs. (16) and (17). The experimental values of d(Dn)/dT are affected only by factor (a) for off-substrate ﬁlms, so those values ex- hibit a clear correlation with Dn. On the other hand, the val- ues of d(Dn)/dT for on-substrate PI ﬁlms are determined by the sum of factors (a) and (b). As schematically shown in Figure 13, the d(Dn)/dT originating from factor (a) exhibits an opposite dependence on the degree of chain orientation to that originating from factor (b). This is the essential reason that the behaviors of d(Dn)/dT observed for on-substrate PI ﬁlms could not be straightforwardly investigated with respect to other structural properties (see Figure 6).\n\nBased on the above investigations, we demonstrated two approaches which effectively reduce the signiﬁcantly large d(Dn)/dT observed for the on-substrate PI ﬁlms. The ﬁrst approach is the reduction of the CTE mismatch by using “polyimide substrates” of which the CTE is well matched to that of the PI ﬁlms. As expected, the d(Dn)/dT for the PI ﬁlms formed on polyimide substrates are as small as those for off-substrate PI ﬁlms (see Table VI). This approach is ad- vantageous in the availability of current optical waveguide PI materials. The second approach is the reduction of C0 G by changing the skeletal structures of PIs by using alicyclic monomers. As shown in Figure 11, the values of d(Dn)/dT for the newly synthesized semi-alicyclic PI ﬁlms range from 9 to 19 ppm/K, which are 30%–50% smaller than those of aromatic PIs. Moreover, the wholly alicyclic PI ﬁlms formed on Si substrates exhibit d(Dn)/dT values in a range of 3– 9 ppm/K. These values are as small as those for the off-substrate ﬂuorinated aromatic PI ﬁlms without residual thermal stress. This approach is facile and advantageous if we have to use Si substrates. In this study, we have demon- strated that the polarization dependence of TO coefﬁcients\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFIG. 13.

The ceramic heater 100 V/A, 10 20 mm) glued on a silicon wafer was driven by AC power. The temperature was controlled by adjustable voltage. Conductive silver paste was used as an adhesive between this apparatus and the sam- ple substrate to achieve good thermal contact. Sample and prism temperature was monitored by a K-type thermocouples glued on the ﬁlm and prism surface with small amounts of silver paste. A laser beam with TE or TM polarization was used for the measurements. The refractive index of the cou- pling prism (gallium gadolinium garnet) at each temperature was calculated using the values of n ¼ 1.9390 at 25 C and dn/dT ¼ 17.2 ppm/K at a wavelength of 1.32 lm.\n\n\\begin{table}\n| 1M.
